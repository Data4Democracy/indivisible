#indivisible Conference call on Feb. 20, 2017, 12 PM ET
Jim Williamson (@jimwilliamson), Paramita Ghosh (@pg), Amanda Bonfitto Howell (@bonfiam), and Mahender Nathan (@mahender) attended.
 
Original Project Proposal from The Loyal Ninety-Nine can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kgymhsnwZQ2GQ1OdoHzfEN3d-djO8zqv0Q2qFxAyfGo/edit?usp=sharing
 
Phase 1: A website with a searchable database of Call to Action (CTA) items from various activism organizations.
* Does not require users to log into
* Collects CTA data from emails sent by organizations to this site
* Organizations need to register their source email address to prevent spam
* Detects users’ location
* Includes filters such as
  * location (can change from the detected current location),
  * date,
  * time required,
  * type of action (calling MOC, attending event, writing Letter to Editor, etc.)
* Auto-populates instructions for calling MOC based on location detected or searched
 
Phase 2: A mobile app and user registration, category browse
 
Phases 3+ (to be fleshed out soon):
* User Dashboard to track activities done
* Incorporate psychological rewards
* Prioritize CTAs from the user’s referring site
* Interface with users’ networks to prioritize CTAs
* Push CTAs based on:  
  * District-specific actions needed
  * Media Markets
  * Tipping Point: focus Actions on events/petitions near a tipping point
  * Social Network Strength – based on info from user’s linked networks
* Link directly through social network sites if user chooses
* Civic education component
 
Action Items:
@jimwilliamson will provide @pg with as many example emails from various organizations as possible
@bonfiam will put out a call for Mobile app developers, and inquire as to backend server options
 
Notes:
1.     How can we handle CTAs that result in phone calls that can’t get through? Need to discuss options and determine best courses of action. This could be a late-stage deliverable.
 
2.     @jonathon indicated that we have server resources for testing and development, but we will need to sort out something for production.
