,"Tell Paul Ryan Not to Dismantle Obamacare
Paul Ryan is conducting a phone poll on the ACA/Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), hoping to hear overwhelming popular opposition to it. Let's overwhelm him with support  for the ACA instead.
What you can do
CALL
Paul Ryan: (202) 225-3031 or (202) 225-0600
You should hear an automated voice menu with options (listen carefully in case the options have changed):
? Press 2 to weigh in on the issue

*KEEP CALLING UNTIL YOU GET THE AUTOMATED VOICE MENU where the ACA survey is an option, they have been rerouting the phone tree constantly.
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
We want to explain our support in terms that everyone can understand, regardless of political leaning; we know everyone has a different experience.
? We firmly believe this policy to be one of Obama's greatest legacies and a gift to the country-many of us have experienced the benefits directly. Healthcare is not cheap, and onboarding an entire country to a system is a complex and bumpy road. The ACA should be honed and improved, not eliminated or slashed by conservatives who counter a policy based on the vague and incorrect notions that the poor are being given a handout and the ACA is a jobs killer.
? Obamacare is a net positive for the economy. US healthcare spending is the
[highest in the world](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24370967)
: Obamacare aims to slow that.
? It does not put undue pressure on small businesses, since it doesn't require companies under the size of 50 to adhere to its policies.

,"Have a Conversation With Your Loved Ones About What's At Stake
If the election proved anything, it's that issues were rarely the issue, and emotional appeals held sway over people's decisions.  This will ring true as many of us head home over the holidays to encounter friends and family on the other side of the political divide.  While it is all too easy to slide into the comforts of a holiday, we cannot normalize our current state of affairs, and whitewash the dangerous political, cultural, and social reality taking place.
What you can do
With the help of our friends at
[Flippable](https://www.flippable.org/)
and guidance from therapists, we've put together some tips and resources for starting the conversation with family and friends:
Be prepared:
[Read this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bC0nyqFNx6VhBgNZDB0Oan1aa0i_UtuWeBLnOPWrJ5M/preview)

[ask questions](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/podcasts/how-could-you-19-questions-to-ask-loved-ones-who-voted-the-other-way.html)
of those you don't agree with, work towards
[finding common ground](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1nLEwmBR_ckC3DaDyLV2IKHAPE_dRGnzomGiTImr-eAI/mobilebasic)
, and if you feel up for counter argument try
[these](http://action.dccc.org/pdf/knowyourstuffing.pdf)
.
Remember that hearing someone out is as important as being heard.
A study shows that
[in-depth conversation](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/magazine/how-do-you-change-voters-minds-have-a-conversation.html)
moves people toward changing their minds.
Keep anger and hurt regarding the candidate separate
from your feelings about the person because it's too easy to demonize someone.
Take into consideration
that many of the people who voted for Trump didn't take his racist, sexist talk literally.  They may have chosen to ignore it then, but don't let them ignore it now.
Challenge yourself
to think in terms of both/and rather than neither/nor.  Two things can be true at the same time rather than mutually exclusive.
If all else fails, text SOS to 82623,
and
[SURJ](http://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/thanksgiving)
will send you talking points to help you through these tough conversations (they'll even jump on a call to coach you through target: blank).

Companies building DAPL secured a
[$2.5 billion loan](http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/who's-banking-dakota-access-pipeline)
from over a dozen banks to build the pipeline, but that money won't be delivered until Standing Rock stands down, so we still have time to stop it. Standing Rock has asked us to join them today, on Divestment Day, to kick off a

WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Phase one of the boycott began yesterday on the anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and will last until Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The first three cities put on watch will be the progressive cities of New York & San Francisco, and Standing Rock. These cities have 43 days to meet the reasonable and humane demands of local activists. While protests have brought increasing awareness to racial injustice, they have not brought about active change by our government and policymakers. From the organizers:
""One of the primary goals of the Injustice Boycott will be to unashamedly hold ?progressive? cities, their elected officials, and the businesses in those cities responsible for the reputations they so enjoy.""
If demands are not met in 45 days, The Injustice Boycott will call for:
? a tourism boycott of those cities
? pulling money out of banks and financial institutions that either support racial injustice and police brutality in those cities or have not come out against them
? a national boycott of large corporations headquartered in those cities
? protests in the city designed to shut down businesses and government

I am concerned about the passage of the so-called ""Heartbeat Bill."" This bill threatens the safety of Ohio women, was passed secretively and unconstitutionally, and violates a woman's right to choose. I implore Governor Kasich to use his line item veto against the bill.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
The ""Heartbeat Bill"" makes abortion illegal after a heartbeat is detected, typically 6 weeks. This is so early that many women don't know they're pregnant, and too early to make the often difficult decision, find a clinic, make an appointment, get time off of work, save money, and go in for a procedure. The ban makes all abortion illegal, even in the case of rape or incest.
For all intents and purposes, this is a full abortion ban.
Ohio legislators also passed
[a second bill banning abortions after 20 weeks](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/07/politics/ohio-abortion-bill/)
. Kasich has 10 days to veto both bills or they automatically become law.
[The Ohio legislators who created this bill](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-jordan-domestic-violence_us_584820ece4b0b9feb0da6031)
cite Trump's election as their motivation. They see that and Republican control of all three branches of government as a mandate to pass extreme  laws against reproductive freedom. Their long term strategy, if this passes, is that a court battle would ensue which

It may seem presumptive of me to ask you how to fulfill your electoral duty, but please consider two important factors before casting your vote. American intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia interfered in the US election with the goal of electing Donald Trump, and this act alone has de-legitimized the validity of his election. Secondly, The Democratic candidate won the popular vote by 2.84 million votes. That is a win margin larger than 11 previously elected presidents. Clinton is the clear choice of the people who voted, and it is your duty as an elector to honor the choice of the people.

,"Don't Apologize for Talking Politics
As we enter the height of the holiday season, you may find yourself across the dinner table from friends and family who do not share your views on the election or who don?t want to talk about the incoming administration. Some of us may be chomping at the bit to get into an argument, and some will shy away under the pretense of holiday appeasement.  Let?s have constructive conversations with everyone about what?s at stake for all of us under the Trump administration.  And let?s not apologize for talking politics!  This is our future we?re talking about.
What you can do
1. EMPATHY IS THE FIRST STEP
and it is the
[hardest part](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2016/11/how_to_do_thanksgiving_with_trump_voting_relatives.html)
of talking across difference.  Fear is felt on both sides of this political divide and it is very hard to be open to new ideas when someone is fearful.  Work towards empathy and
[finding common ground](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1nLEwmBR_ckC3DaDyLV2IKHAPE_dRGnzomGiTImr-eAI/mobilebasic)
with those you disagree with. ?If you are able to accept someone and validate how they see the world, even if it?s contrary to your own view, then they might actually stop feeling so threatened with you. And then, you could actually have a conversation with them about what they?re so scared about.?
2. VOICE YOUR CONCERNS
clearly and advocate for yourself. Those who voted for Trump may not have taken his racist, sexist, and extremist speech seriously then, but don?t let them ignore it now.
3. THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE THE LONG GAME
.  You won?t change anyone?s mind over dinner or even a holiday weekend, but if you are able to direct the conversation towards an environment of tolerance, then you are at a good place for continued future conversations.
4. READ
[this conversation toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bC0nyqFNx6VhBgNZDB0Oan1aa0i_UtuWeBLnOPWrJ5M/preview)
if you're a white person, which includes tips for speaking up for racial justice.
5. TEXT SOS TO  82623
if you get stuck with the above and
[SURJ](http://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/thanksgiving)
will send you talking points to help you through these tough conversations (they'll even jump on a call to coach you through).
6. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FEEL PREPARED TO SIT DOWN WITH FAMILY OR IN-LAWS WHO SUPPORTED TRUMP, IT'S OK TO STAY AWAY THIS YEAR.
If you do, it's important to tell them, unemotionally if possible, that you love them but that you feel hurt and scared and that their vote was one that affects you (or your friends) personally, and therefore feels like a personal affront, so you don't feel prepared to share a meal with them at this moment. Dan Savage says that our only leverage as adults is our presence in our family's lives, and when we use it we need to let them know that. A therapist we consulted also said its important to state your feelings about this situation clearly, but then avoid falling down the rabbit hole into a fight. So be clear, be kind, and let them know that their actions have consequences.",2017-06-06 23:51:12.678316,,,Don't Apologize for Talking Politics,Parsed www.2hoursaweek.org for training data,,[],2hoursaweek.org,"['29', 'mindfulness']",['action'],http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/don-t-apologize-for-talking-politics

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
This march follows a history of important civil rights marches that took place in our country's capital.  Namely the March on Washington in 1963 and the Million Man March in 1995.   Marches are powerful symbolic actions, but they are also an indicator of a greater social movement taking place.  It can be a way to motivate others to action, and galvanize support among the issues we care about.  All successful movements in American history have both an inside and an outside strategy.  This is just the beginning of ours.

to rid your feed of fake news!
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
First of all, we allow our view of the world around us to be shaped by people whose intentions are ?neutral? at best. Secondly, we train our brains to see the news as a free commodity, largely disconnected from the institutions that produce it. And we let ourselves get out of the habit of critically examining our sources. The truth is that no news is independent news. Every story gets written by someone, and published by someone, and may or may not get fact checked by someone.
None of us have an endless amount of time to spend reading up on every domestic and foreign issue that matters to us ? we have to rely on other people to tell us what matters and why it matters and to give us enough of the facts of the matter than we might make informed decisions about how to live in and engage with the world. We have to pick our crew of informants carefully.

,"Stop Republicans from banning live streaming in Congress
House Republicans are attempting to
[ban live streaming](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-12-24/ryan-proposes-fines-ethics-moves-on-grandstanding-house-members)
and taking photos from the floor of Congress. A law will be voted on tomorrow that would fine and punish our representatives for sharing images and videos with the public. Transparency and civilian and press oversight of government is at the heart of our national heritage, and this flies in the face of necessary and long-standing traditions that keep balance in our government.

I'm calling to urge Rep. Ryan to withdraw his proposal to ban live streaming and photography on the Congressional floor. It's an unfair attempt to silence and hobble the minority and goes against our Democracy's inherent spirit of transparency and openness with its constituency.
Be polite, concise and personal.
Leave a message if you don?t reach a live person.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Republicans want to fine Congressmen who violate the ban $500 for a first infraction and then $2,500 for subsequent infractions. This is a response to Democrats live streaming their
[sit-in protest](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/democrats-stage-senate-floor-sit-in-over-guns.html)
on gun control after the Orlando shooting. After the sit-in began, Ryan ordered the C-Span cameras shut off and Democrats responded by live-streaming the protest themselves.
It?s vital that in a Republican controlled government that has shown no commitment to playing fair or following long-standing traditions of government, citizens are able to keep an eye on the daily actions in Congress. Without transparency and access by press and citizens alike, we cannot trust that the members of our government will act in the best interest of the citizenry.
Additionally, the law will also impose

While the next President is not inaugurated until January 20th, the new Congress has already returned to work.

,"How Cabinet appointments get confirmed and what we can do about it
Over the past two months, we have reacted with disbelief to the President-elect's cabinet picks. Many of these appointees come from the private-sector and from within an industry that presents a direct conflict of interest with the department they intend to oversee. Rather than ""draining the swamp,"" Trump has filled his cabinet with billionaire CEO's, and corporate and Washington insiders.
As Congress gets back to work, a schedule of confirmation hearings has already been announced for some of these top positions.  Here is a quick guide to how the confirmation process works. Over the next few days, we will be sending out actions to directly address individual appointees. For now, find some time to read up on how the process works and how Senate Democrats can possibly disrupt it.
What you can do
1. LEARN
about all the cabinet appointees
[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-administration-appointee-tracker/)
.
2. READ
up on the process of cabinet confirmation
[here](http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a24397/trump-cabinet-appointments-senate-approval-process/)
.
Here's a quick breakdown of the above article:
a) A nomination is given to the
[relevant senate committee](http://2hoursaweek.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=542e52557cb249fb2535906ea&id=d97f042111&e=ac39528846)
(made up of Republican and Democratic Senators).
b) That committee can then hold hearings, vote to move the nomination straight to the Senate floor for a vote or not move on it at all (in which case, the committee effectually kills the nomination).
c) After hearings, the committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate. It may vote to report the nomination favorably, unfavorably or without recommendation. If a committee sits on an appointment, the full Senate may vote to
[invoke cloture](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/be873e40-a966-4feb-9d72-cf23a93cbe46.pdf)
and move the nomination along.
d) If a nomination clears committee, it moves to the Senate floor and can be confirmed by a simple majority Senate vote.
3. STRATEGIZE
Although Democrats cannot block the vote, Senate Democrats can slow down the process by asking the the party leader, Chuck Schumer, to
[delay the vote](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2001/01/senate_confirmation_faq.html)
. They can also ask for
[30 hours of debate](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-cabinet-democrats-senate-232136)
on each nomination. This is what Republicans did to obstruct and effectively kill Obama's Supreme Court Justice nomination. We must make clear to Schumer and other Democratic Senators, that we need them to employ all and any tactics to fight these nominations.
4. BEGIN TO ACT
Find out if one of your state senators is on a
[relevant committee](http://www.senate.gov/committees/committees_home.htm)
holding a hearing for the nomination, and start writing and calling any time. And look out for our detailed actions in response to many of these nominations over the next few days.",2017-06-06 23:51:21.748791,,,How Cabinet appointments get confirmed and what we can do about it,Parsed www.2hoursaweek.org for training data,,[],2hoursaweek.org,"['39', 'personal']",['action'],http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/how-cabinet-appointments-get-confirmed-and-what-we-can-do-about-it

?s Democrats have asked for a four day hearing and the calling of multiple witnesses, but Republican Committee
[Chair Chuck Grassley has declined and limited the hearing to two days](https://www.thenation.com/article/republicans-are-planning-to-rush-through-jeff-sessionss-confirmation-hearing/)
with only 4 witnesses from the Democratic side.  On top of this, Sessions has submitted
[remarkably incomplete](http://www.afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Second-Sessions-Memo.pdf)
answers to the Committee?s questionnaire and also will not recuse himself from voting for himself.
What you can do
1. CALL
the heads and ranking members of the
[Judiciary Committee](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/about/members)
. If one of these senators is from your state, make sure to provide your zipcode during the call. If you have friends and family from the states of any of these Republican senators, please ask them to call as well.
Here's a breakdown of asks to important committee senators:
[Chuck Grassley](http://www.grassley.senate.gov/explore/washington-dc-office)
- Republican Senator of Iowa, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee
202-224-3744 / 515-288-1145
We need to stress that Sessions and his background of intolerance and bigotry is un-American. Sessions? cavalier attitude towards the confirmation process shows that he thinks he doesn?t have to play by the same rules. He must submit the missing records for 20 years of work as Alabama US attorney , attorney general, and senator before the hearing takes place. Sessions himself has put up a fight against Obama nominations when they were not comprehensive in their questionnaires. He is subject to the same rules.
[Lindsey Graham](http://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/office-locations)
- Republican Senator of South Carolina
202-224-5972 / 803-933-0112
Because Graham is considered somewhat moderate and bi-partisan these days, he is a good one to appeal to on basis of his dislike of Trump and his willingness to work with Democrats. His state also has a large African American constituency, whose vote would be assuredly undermined under Sessions. Stress Sessions past history of racially motivated litigation.
[Patrick Leahy](https://www.leahy.senate.gov/contact)
- Democratic Senator of Vermont, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee
202-224-4242 / 802-863-2525
[Dianne Feinstein](http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/washington-dc)
- Democratic Senator of California

[Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/office-locations)
- Democratic Senator of New York
202-224-6542 / 212-486-4430 / 518-431-4070
2. CALL
We need to press all Judiciary Committee Democrats to make this a tough non-conciliatory hearing on Sessions. Their constituents are comprised of diverse racial backgrounds, many of whom would be directly targeted and undermined by Sessions and his policies. If the nomination goes to the senate floor for a vote, they must put a
[hold on the nomination](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2001/01/senate_confirmation_faq.html)
and delay the vote. States with Democratic representation in the committee: CA, CT, DE, IL, MN, NY, RI.
3. CALL
If your Republican Senator in on the committee, put pressure on them to hold Sessions accountable to a full review and confirmation process at the very least (and vote against him at the most!). States with Republican representation in the committee: AL, AZ, GA, LA, NC, SC, TX, UT.
SCRIPT - please add relevant material from above depending on who you are calling (feel free to ad-lib, of course)
Hello, I am calling to express my opposition to the appointment of Jeff Sessions for attorney general.  I believe his bigotry, record of intolerance, and racially motivated litigation to be unAmerican and unacceptable for the role of top law enforcement official in our country.  In addition, his omission of decades of records shows his utter disrespect for the process of his confirmation.  He must play by the same rules as all past nominations and be subjected to a full review of his record.
If calling a Democratic senator, add:
Please fight against this nomination and make sure that Jeff Sessions entire record is fully reviewed in the hearing.  This is no time to be conciliatory.  Your constituents are counting on you to serve them well and not confirm a man whose policies will directly harm them and their families.

Hello, I am calling to register my strong opposition to Betsy DeVos as secretary of education. I want to let you know I am watching the confirmation hearings closely. Betsy DeVos has never worked in a school in any capacity. As a proponent of charter schools and voucher programs, she shows her lack of interest in supporting poorer communities, the ones with parents who work full-time and struggle to simply keep up. The president of the National Education Association has said that DeVos ""?has done more to undermine public education than support students"".  As a firm believer in the American dream, I do not feel that the United States of America will be a country of equality, or be poised to be a globally competitive producer of strong, educated minds with Betsy DeVos' combined set of values and lack of experience.

Hello, my name is
__
and I'm urging you to oppose Dr. Ben Carson's appointment to HUD secretary. The American people deserve a qualified person to lead the agency. Carson is not that person, especially since he declined a previous federal agency position due to his lack of experience. He has clearly shown in past statements his belief in a bootstraps mentality that does not show a comprehension of the complex role housing plays in overcoming the extreme economic disparities that are only widening in the United States.

REX TILLERSON
Hello, my name is [your name]. I?m calling today to ask the Senator to prevent Rex Tillerson from becoming the next Secretary of State. We can?t afford to have a friend of Vladimir Putin representing our country abroad, nor can we afford to have someone who put his own financial interests above those of the American people. Please, on behalf of our nation, do not allow Rex Tillerson to become Secretary of State.
JEFF SESSIONS
Hello, I am calling to express my opposition to the appointment of Jeff Sessions for attorney general.  I believe his record of intolerance, and racially motivated litigation to be unAmerican and unacceptable for the role of top law enforcement official in our country.  In addition, his omission of decades of records shows his utter disrespect for the process of his confirmation. He must play by the same rules as all past nominations and be subjected to a full review of his record.",2017-06-06 23:51:23.694361,,,Push Flippable Republicans to Oppose Rex Tillerson & Jeff Sessions,Parsed www.2hoursaweek.org for training data,,[],2hoursaweek.org,"['44', 'anti_trump']",['action'],http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/push-flippable-republicans-to-oppose-rex-tillerson-jeff-sessions

toward repealing the Affordable Care Act. We need to act now, and the public outcry must be loud and clear!
If you or anyone you know relies on the ACA, this will be obvious. But even if you don't, a repeal will affect your

too.
No complacency - this affects everyone!

1. CALL

2. CALL
these 5 Republican Senators who have
[broken away from the GOP](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/obamacare-repeal-might-have-just-died-tonight.html)

Hello, I am calling because I oppose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It provides much needed health insurance to 22.5 million Americans, not to mention many critical protections for those who receive insurance through an employer. I am incredibly disappointed by Wednesday night's Senate vote, and the ruthless manner in which Republicans seek to rob Americans of their healthcare. I advise Representative_
to vote to continue the ACA. If I see that Representative__
votes for the repeal, they will not have my vote in their upcoming election.
(Please share your own ACA story - this is the most powerful way to convey the message to your congressperson).

Hello, I am calling to urge Senator _____ to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA. We need a regulatory approach that looks to the future, not someone who sits back on his haunches and takes kickbacks from the energy industry. Environmental protection should be of national concern because clean air and water flow from state to state and pollution does not stop at a state's border. Pruitt has let his own state of Oklahoma be run over by the oil and gas industry, whose fracking has caused a record 907 earthquakes last year, alone. Protest this appointment for the sake of our planet and our future.

,"Oppose Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary
Yet another billionaire has been tossed into the ring of cabinet positions. Steven Mnuchin, former Goldman Sachs executive, and current hedge fund and banking mogul will have his senate confirmation hearing this

Mnuchin earned his first fortune the old-fashioned way, he inherited it. And has gone on to represent the worst of

Hello, I am calling to urge Senator _____ to oppose the nomination of Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary.  If our president-elect truly believes in ridding government of it's pay-to-play politics, this would be a choice in the opposite direction. Mr. Mnuchin is a wall street pro who has orchestrated the enrichment of himself and his fellow financiers off the backs of ordinary families, seniors, and working class communities, through predatory mortgage practices and foreclosures.  I am concerned that as treasury secretary he will oversee tax policy that will ensure that the wealthy stay wealthy, while ordinary Americans pay more than their fair share to make up the difference.

,"HALT THE REPEAL OF THE ACA BEFORE JANUARY 27
What's the rush for repealing the ACA? To deliver on a highly partisan grudge and dismantle a crucial legacy from a Democratic administration.
It took Democrats
[an entire year](http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/28/politics/supreme-court-health-timeline/)
to create the policy that onboarded an entire country to healthcare. Republicans had 6 years to propose an alternative, and they did nothing until they could set in motion a high-profile train wreck. They simply want to pull the plug and deal with the consequences later. Or not deal.
If you're not one of the
[30 million moderate income individuals that would lose health insurance](http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/12-7-16health-factsheets-us.pdf)
with a repeal, you're probably one of the 150 million who get health insurance through their job.
[You will be affected too](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/01/11/get-health-insurance-through-your-employer-aca-repeal-will-affect-you-too/)
. The Senate has already voted 51 to 48 to end coverage for preexisting conditions, remove discrimination protection for women in healthcare; voted against the provision allowing children to remain on their parent's insurance till the age of 26, and against ACA contraceptive coverage and maternity care provision, among other things.
We need to make noise now. Some Republican senators have broken with the fast-tracking of a repeal, expressing doubt in this approach without an alternative ready. Let's call them and tell them we need them to stick to their guns.
What you can do
1. CALL SENATORS
who are open to the idea of slowing the repeal (7 min):
Senator Bob Corker (R-TN): (202) 224-3344
Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK): (202) 224-6665
Senator Rob Portman (R-OH): (202) 224-3353
Senator Susan Collins (R-ME): (202) 224-2523
Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA): (202) 224-5824
Senator Rand Paul (R-KY): (202) 224-4343
2. CALL YOUR SENATOR

]?s efforts to slow repeal of the ACA without an alternative. I am calling to ask the [Senator/Representative] to continue to insist on a viable alternative to the ACA before it is repealed. To me any real alternative must meet and include the following bare minimums:
? Parental policies
? No denial based on pre-existing conditions
? No age discrimination
? Subsidies for those who can?t afford it to get care
? Expansion of Medicare. Shrinking, not growing the donut hole

,"J20: A DAY FOR GATHERING STRENGTH
Welcome to the New Future.
It depends on us.
It has been an exceptional two months. We are ready to meet a truly exceptional and uncertain future. It's hard to overstate how overwhelming this time has been. It's by design. Let's stay focused, because it will get harder before it gets easier. We will not be overcome.
The good news is this: People have sprung into action. We all know 700% more about our political process than before the election.
We had an amazing 2HAW meeting last weekend, attended by the executive director of the Common Cause NY. This incredible woman, who has been an activist for four decades, told us that we're on the right track. She also said: be tedious. Choose the one or two issues that you care about. Learn everything you can and find organizations to help amplify your voice. Tell your supermarket cashier how you feel, tell your family, your friends, your Facebook friends. Wash, rinse, repeat. Be tedious, be relentless. We're here for you, and we are so glad you're here for us.

You need to have a sit down with your member of Congress. We get it, it's a little freaky to go to their office. But they were hired to represent you, and their office is where you can and should be putting pressure to oppose this administration.
[Don't assume that just because they're Democrats they'll be supporting your interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/5nisw5/these_democrats_just_voted_against_bernies/)
, how can they if they don't know what you want? So go tell them! If your employee started using the company's credit card to take all their friends out to lunch, you'd probably say something to HR, right?
One very simple way to start a direct discussion with your senators is to sign up for the effort that our friends at MoveOn have launched hosting rallies at the offices of our MOCs every Tuesday for the first 100 days of the Trump administration.

,"Who are your friends in Red States?
Let's get a real-life buddy system going with our friends in Red states (including if you already live in one!). By pairing up and holding each other accountable for small actions like writing letters, we can ensure our progressive voice is heard by senators where the conservative voice is loudest. We're going to use this strategy again and again for various issues. First up: oppose the fast-track repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
What you can do
1. Find your friends on Facebook who live in Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Maine, Alaska, or Nevada
In Facebook's search bar, type these exact words: ""Friends who live in Tennessee."" Repeat for the above-mentioned states, which either have
[senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/)
who have expressed doubts about passing a repeal of the ACA without a replacement, or who are up for re-election in swing states in 2018.
2. Ask those friends to write a postcard to their senator
, or make a phone call telling their senator's office they oppose a repeal of the ACA If you haven't talked to the friend in a while, or you need an icebreaker, use our friendly script below!
3. Tell them you will be asking them for other things, too
Not everyone has had a stellar experience with the ACA, so this may not be the issue they want to weigh in on. But we need those supporters in red states. Ask them if you can reach out to them for help, and tell them how powerful their voice is in putting  pressure on our representatives in conservative regions.
4. If you have extra time, and are chomping at the bit to do more, get in touch with friends who live in any state with a Republican senator
. We named the 6 above, here are the others:
Wyoming, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Idaho, Montana, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Georgia, Wisconsin, Kansas, Ohio, Florida, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Indiana

*Hi pal! (<--insert your pal's name here)
Since the election I have been actively fighting for the issues I care about, but I live in a blue state where I am represented by Democratic politicians who are in the minority in congress. So I am reaching out to my friends in states with Republican senators, especially those who have expressed doubt about repealing the Affordable Care Act.  In this fight, your voice is louder than mine.  That's why I am asking you to get in touch with your senator and let them know you oppose the repeal of the ACA. If you haven't had a great experience with the ACA yourself, consider that it shouldn't disappear without a replacement. And continue to write them about the issues you care about that are under attack by the new administration.
Here's what this new political action group, 2hoursaweek.org is suggesting: buy a pack of notecards and a book of stamps (you can buy both at most drugstores). Find your senator's address here and write them a short postcard. You can also call them if you feel comfy on the phone and tell them the same thing.

We know you all had a tough weekend of
[disbelief](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/trump-begins-his-unconstitutional-program-anti-muslim-discrimination)
,
[anger](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/opinion/donald-trumps-muslim-ban-is-cowardly-and-dangerous.html?_r=0)
, sadness and confusion, and we know that many of you were

standing up for American values of inclusivity and diversity.
[These actions are working](http://www.gq.com/story/aclu-muslim-ban-orders)
,
[our Senators are listening](http://www.today.com/news/chuck-schumer-donald-trump-s-travel-ban-i-ll-ask-t107531)
, and according to MoveOn,
[our judges are forming opinions shaped by our outcries](https://www.aclu.org/news/federal-court-grants-stay-challenge-trump-immigration-ban)
.
We must keep acting, and we must understand how the ban relates to the cabinet picks being forced through Congress
. Jeff Sessions' job as Attorney General would be to protect American citizens and hold the government accountable, neither of which he can do since
[he is believed to be an architect of the Muslim Ban](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/28/donald-trump-s-refugee-ban-has-attorney-general-nominee-jeff-session-s-fingerprints-all-over-it.html)
and other dangerous and unconstitutional policies being enacted.
We spoke with our Senator's aide on Friday and he told us that our outcries shaped her decision on DeVos, but they haven't been hearing as much outrage about Sessions. The ACLU is asking for our help on this.
We have to make noise TODAY, they are listening!!!

For Call #1
Hi Rep/Sen
____
Thank you for speaking out and voicing your concerns about the muslim ban. I am asking you to go a step further in protecting the rights of those who live in this country. I am deeply concerned about the unchecked power of the president if Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson are confirmed.  There is strong evidence that both of them will carry out executive orders without the moral clarity and constitutional respect required of their jobs as Attorney General and Secretary of State.  Please speak up against their confirmations.  Please also speak up against Steve Bannon's appointment to the National Security Council.  He is wholly unqualified to make decisions regarding the safety and protection of Americans.
For Call #2
Hi Sen_
__
I am deeply disappointed that you sided with Republicans on Monday night to clear the path for Rex Tillerson's confirmation. His statements regarding a muslim registry make him wholly unfit to serve as secretary of state.

,"Fight Against the Gun Control Rollback
In 1938 Karl Frederick, the NRA?s president said, ?I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons... I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.?
On thursday, House Republicans (and some Democrats!) employed a rarely used tool called the
[Congressional Review Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Review_Act)
to
[rollback a measure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/house-gop-aims-to-scrap-obama-rule-on-gun-background-checks/2017/02/02/2cb340aa-e977-11e6-903d-9b11ed7d8d2a_story.html?utm_term=.f154ba969259)
that prevented those with mental illness from being able to buy guns. The Obama regulation required those with a mental disorder so severe they cannot work or handle their own finances to be entered into a gun-buying background check system. The background check would prevent them from being able to purchase a firearm.
This is a common sense gun control measure, put into place in the wake of shootings like Sandy Hook. And it barely scratched the surface of our nation's gun problems. It has always been clear that the Republicans, and some Democrats, are willing to barter away our safety and well-being in order to
[stay cozy with the gun industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/opinion/trump-and-other-republicans-do-the-gun-lobbys-bidding.html?_r=0)

Hi Rep/Sen
__
, I am outraged at the houses's vote to rollback a common sense gun control measure.  This was the bare minimum of checks that we could've put into place in the wake of shootings like Sandy Hook, and the increasing number of gun-related deaths in our country.
If speaking with Republican,
The measure was written to apply to a very narrow group of those who are severely mentally ill, not to a broader range of people with disabilities, as many who voted claimed. This is not a rollback on an infringement of rights, but rather a favor to the NRA and the gun lobby.  It is very clear to me that you did not have the health and safety of your constituents at heart when making this vote.",2017-06-06 23:51:31.414485,,,Fight Against the Gun Control Rollback,Parsed www.2hoursaweek.org for training data,,[],2hoursaweek.org,"['63', 'policy']",['action'],http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/fight-against-the-gun-control-rollback

to the Trump campaign has garnered him a cabinet nomination for Labor secretary.
Many past labor secretaries have lead big corporations, but Puzder's corporation, CKE Restaurants, is majorly concerning because it is the fourth worst labor violations offender in the industry. A study by the Department of Labor (DOL) reported that 60% of CKE restaurants had at least one
[Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/)

In addition, Puzder has been a

to millions of workers. He is opposed to the ACA because it increases costs for employers, and is an advocate of automation that could increase profits by replacing workers with machines.
His appointment is antithetical to the mission of the Department of Labor. Andrew Puzder has made it clear that he cares only for the bottom line, and will be

Hello Senator
__
I, and my community organizing group 2 Hours A Week, oppose the confirmation of Andrew Puzder for labor secretary. His entire career has been built on opposing and tearing down the regulations that safeguard American workers from harmful and predatory labor practices. He is looking out for the interests of business owners and their bottom line, not that of the worker and their daily wage. If you care at all about those of us who go to work everyday in your state, and our welfare as laborers, you will say ""no"" to Puzder for secretary of Labor.",2017-06-06 23:51:36.668352,,,Oppose Puzder for Labor Secretary,Parsed www.2hoursaweek.org for training data,,[],2hoursaweek.org,"['64', 'anti_trump']",['action'],http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/oppose-puzder-for-labor-secretary
,"Make America Broke Again: It's Happening
Trump has jumped right into helping his Wall Street cronies line their pockets. It's becoming clear that he is more concerned with rewarding his big donors and privileging big banks and corporations than with protecting the American public from another economic collapse.
Last week
[he issued an Executive Order ordering the Treasury Department to work with other agencies to review the Dodd-Frank Act](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/04/513388228/the-impact-of-trumps-effort-to-roll-back-financial-regulations)

He's asking that the agencies make recommendations on

. The
[Dodd-Frank Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act)
was passed in response to the 2008 Financial Crisis. It curbs the unchecked deregulation that led to the financial industry plunging the U.S. into recession, which in turn triggered a global financial meltdown.
Trump is also intent on weakening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) through a ""restructuring"" that may involve replacing CFPB's current head. Call your representatives today and let them know that we expect them to stand with the American people and not Wall Street and that they must prepare to oppose attempts to deregulate the financial industry.

,"Please Do Not Counter Protest at Planned Parenthood
Many of us are enraged over the continued legislation of our bodies and choices. Rightfully so. You may have heard that there are anti-choice protests planned for Feb 11th as part of the movement to defund Planned Parenthood.
However, if you are planning to organize or attend any counter protests at Planned Parenthood on Feb 11th or anytime thereafter, please reconsider. We have heard directly from Planned Parenthood that they DO NOT WANT ANY COUNTER PROTESTS. They cause more chaos and make it harder for them to do their main job of providing much needed healthcare to the members of our communities.
Counter protests also bring more attention to the anti-choice protests and create more work for PP, who are already working non-stop in the fight to preserve our healthcare rights. They have spent decades in this fight, and they know what works and what doesn't.  So let's support Planned Parenthood by changing our counter protests to a helpful action (one that doesn't interfere with access to clinics )!  We list some ideas below
What you can do
1. 7 ACTIONS
[You Can Do to help Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/7-things-you-can-do-to-help-planned-parenthood-and-the-communities-it-serves)

.  Always coordinate with the clinic before taking any action. They want your support but it's best organized through a dialogue with a PP clinic.

,"New York has it's very own pipeline: Spectra
New York has it's very own fracked gas pipeline you've probably never heard of, but that likely already feeds to your kitchen. The
[Spectra Pipeline](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/30234-doing-the-unthinkable-giant-gas-pipeline-to-flank-a-new-york-nuclear-power-plant)
, also known as the
[Spectra Algonquin Incremental Market [AIM]](http://www.spectraenergy.com/Operations/US-Natural-Gas-Operations/New-Projects-US/Algonquin-Incremental-Market-AIM-Project/)
pipeline is an approximately three-foot wide, high-pressure shale gas pipeline carrying fracked natural gas running from Pennsylvania up to Canada. This gas is both for export and for distribution to NY through National Grid and Con Ed.
The first section is already operational, and
[enters Manhattan in the West Village](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/41163777/fire%20radius%20arrow%20med.jpg)
. This fracked gas is
[already known to carry radon](http://chelseanow.com/2014/05/concerns-linger-over-radon-levels-in-spectra-pipeline-gas/)
. Besides the
[environmental realities of fracked gas and the already-confirmed presence of radon](https://indypendent.org/2013/08/17/putting-it-all-pipeline)
, there is another threat with this pipeline:  further upstate, it sits

from the edge of aging Indian Point Power Plant,
[which uses some of the most outdated technology available for cooling spent fuel rods](https://www.nirs.org/wp-content/uploads/closeindianpoint/water-and-indianpoint.pdf)
.
The second of three phases of construction is set to begin, pending certain permissions. The next window of time in which to act against the Spectra Pipeline is now. While the pipeline is regulated at the federal level, they need the approval of the state, specifically Governor Andrew Cuomo, for water quality permits in order to proceed. Today's action focuses on education about the pipeline so we can prepare to act starting in the next few weeks.
What you can do
1. Read up on the history of the pipeline and understand the risks it presents to you.
You probably haven't heard of it because its parent company broke the construction of the pipeline into three sections in order to garner less media attention.

,"February 17: General Strike
At this dangerous point in our history, we must confront how our participation in the economy has made us complicit in Donald Trump's rise to power.  How do we change our relationship to the economy to empower ourselves rather than the economic system in place?
One of our most powerful weapons is our cooperation in the economic establishment by way of our labor and our dollars. This Friday February 17th, a general strike has been called for!
The logic of the general strike is simple. Through cooperative action, each and every one of us refuses to comply with whatever orders the economic establishment has given to us. We don't go to work, we don't buy anything, and we join our fellow citizens in the streets and in our communities in a peaceful display of resistance and solidarity.
What you can do
1. DON'T BUY ANYTHING
Shop the day before if necessary. We want the economy to register a dip in activity as a method of protest.
2. DON'T GO TO WORK OR SCHOOL
, if possible. Plan a day of peaceful protest or community service.
[Here](http://strike4democracy.com/how-we-strike)
is a list of ways to get involved on this day of strike, even if you only have your lunch break in which to act.
3. REACH OUT TO YOUR REPS AND SENATORS
and tell them you are striking in protest of this administration.

investigation taking place, and that is surely good news, but we wanted to explain here what this means and what other avenue of investigation is worth demanding.
The
[Senate Intelligence Committee](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/)
is a standing committee that has taken the lead into the Russia inquiry because it has the widest authority to look into all of the executive branch?s intelligence agencies. But it does not traditionally operate in a bi-partisan manner - Republicans on committee have full control over all subpoenas that get issued, which witnesses (if any) are compelled to testify, and which records have to be preserved during the investigation.  The committee also operates behind closed doors, doing most of its work in secret.
While this is certainly a step in the right direction, a more aggressive and independent investigation would happen with the creation of a
[bi-partisan select committee](http://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/2/16/14630856/evelyn-farkas-trump-russia-flynn)
.  This committee would be solely devoted to the investigation and would give both parties equal power, with public hearings, and
[transparency regarding findings](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/17/14635966/congress-russia-putin-trump)
.
Democrats have backed down from asking for the select committee, but we need to put pressure on them to still demand it.  The senate intelligence committee will conduct the bulk of it's inquiry in private, the way many Republicans want it, shielding Trump from any revelations in the media until they make a conclusion.

We fought hard to prevent the confirmation of Oklahoma's attorney general Scott Pruitt as new head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
While he was confirmed, our efforts were not without impact.
The vote was close, closer than expected; more senators voted against Pruitt than any previous EPA nominee in its 46-year history; Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, crossed party lines to vote no; EPA employees broke rank to write letters against his nomination; and 3,000 emails linking Pruitt to energy interests were released on Wednesday.

Unlikely as it seems, defenders of Pruitt map one path forward for us.
In the lead up to his hearing, the Competitive Enterprise Institute wrote a letter of support stating Pruitt ""understands that many of the nation's challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level."" During his confirmation hearing last month, Pruitt himself said ""It is our state regulators who oftentimes best understand the local needs and the uniqueness of our environmental challenges.""
State and local governments can and will act as bulwark against the coming roll back of federal environmental regulations and life-saving public health measures the E.P.A. enforces
like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Act, the WOTUS rule, and the Good Neighbor Act, as well as broader efforts to support divestment from the fossil economy, Indigenous sovereignty, the EPA's Clean Power Plan, and the Paris Climate Agreement. Regulations are tied up in lengthy bureaucratic processes and courts and cannot be overturned overnight. Climate scientists, local government, and environmental groups - along with unaffiliated citizens and activists - can and will resist their dismantling at every turn. We will double down our efforts at the state, local, and grassroots scale to safeguard the health of our environment and our communities.
Here are some good things happening on the state level:
Illinois implemented the Future Energy Jobs Bill, its most significant climate and energy bill in the state's history, in December. Ohio and Michigan are making similar plans.
Seattle City Council unanimously approved an ordinance to end its relationship with Wells Fargo, an investor in the DAPL pipeline and the company building it, Energy Transfer Partners of Texas. This will cost the bank $3 billion dollars a year.
Despite Wednesday's devastating removal of the Water Protectors at Standing Rock, statements this week from NYC
[Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Comptroller Scott Stringer give us reason to think officials are listening and responding to the call respect Indigenous land, disproportionately targeted by extraction industries](https://gofossilfree.org/new-york-takes-a-major-step-forward-to-defunddapl-and-divestny/)
. Both DeBlasio and Stringer publicly expressed disapproval of the Dakota Access Pipeline: DeBlasio sent a letter to banks letting them know that financing the pipeline comes with ""serious risks."" Stringer joined 120+ investors speaking out against #DAPL and called on banks to ""take meaningful action and develop a new plan that respects the tribe and the sovereignty of their land.""
1. Our main assignment for you now: start becoming familiar with your State Senate.
Use
[this](https://openstates.org/)
website to learn who your State Senators are, who comprise the upper house of legislature in your state. Your state legislature's primary purpose is to draft and approve changes to the laws of your state. Set a calendar for yourself to check in every few weeks to see what bills are up in the State Senate--it will take a minute to get used to, but this is the best way to start being apprised of legislation at the state level.

,"Being Progressive In Being United
We know that some of you are disappointed with the outcome of the election of DNC chair.  Though we were momentarily disappointed, we realized that, hey,
[Tom Perez is a progressive](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-perez-isnt-as-liberal-as-keith-ellison-but-hes-still-pretty-progressive/)
, the first Latino chair of the DNC, with an extensive background in civil rights justice and labor rights and he appointed Keith Ellison to Deputy Chair. That doesn't sound like a defeat to us.
If, what we truly care about, are the principles that will shape the future of the democratic party, then
[both candidates laid out very similar visions](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/why-tom-perez-strong-competitor-against-keith-ellison-democratic-party)
for the DNC. Both called for a more decentralized organization that placed greater emphasis on the particular political climates and needs of each state, better candidate recruitment, and appealing to voters of all demographics to speak past the party?s traditional base.
Please don't let
[Trump sow the seeds of divisiveness](https://www.rawstory.com/2017/02/perez-and-ellison-jab-trump-a-guy-getting-help-from-the-russians-cant-call-dnc-election-rigged/)
into the left, by calling the election ""rigged.""  The other night Perez tweeted back to Trump that he shouldn't be ""too happy"" with his nomination and to prepare for him becoming
[his worst nightmare](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/25/politics/trump-tweets-congratulations-to-perez-on-dnc-win)
and as of last week, he has already called for an investigation into Russia's election interference.
""Tom Perez said on stage that anyone who casts off and minimizes the support that Rep. Keith Ellison has along with the Bernie Sanders supporters does so at their own peril.
He is on the right team. Regardless of who won, they see the power in uniting the more progressive side of the party. And they would have appointed one another. This was strategic. And they already have a plan of action for the mid term elections.
We have to keep tracking, hold both accountable, and keep moving forward in the good fight.""

,"Request a Special Investigator for Trump's Ties to Russia
Though Republicans have committed to investigating Trump's ties to Russia, under current circumstances, they could easily scuttle the investigation. This is particularly concerning given the new revelations that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose Justice Department oversees the FBI investigation,
[did not disclose his contact with the Russian Ambassador while Russian-led cyberattacks were underwa](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?utm_term=.4db67bab2981)
y. In fact, he lied about having contact with them! In addition, several Congressional Intelligence Committees?all Republican led?are conducting investigations into the allegations.
[The problem is that all of these investigations are being led by partisan Republicans](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/321601-gingrich-calls-for-independent-person-for-trump-russia-probe)
, some of whom
[don't take the allegations of collusion very seriously](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/paul-ryan-trump-russia-ties-special-prosecutor-235485)
.  Sessions, a longtime Trump ally, finally recused himself today from the investigation?one that he should never have been a part of.
The bottom line: Republicans can't be trusted to lead an impartial investigation when it's obviously not in their best interest to do so. For these reasons it's imperative that Congressional Democrats demand an independent prosecutor to lead the investigation.
Let's give them a call and let them know what they need to do next?now is NOT the time to let up!
What you can do
1. CALL and thank Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA.) for supporting and advocating for an independent prosecutor
?positive reinforcement is important!

2. CALL Democratic Congressional leadership and ask that they demand an independent prosecutor:

,"Women's Strike on March 8
Women (cis and trans), lead inherently political lives, in the choices they make everyday while living in a society that still does not offer true equality. Striking is our way of protesting not just this administration but also the societal barriers that it reinforces.
The next large scale, planned strike is occurring this Wednesday, March 8.
This is the
[Women's Strike](https://www.womenstrikeus.org/)
. It is a recommitment to the equality and diversity that is threatened under a Trump administration. It is a declaration of the fact that
[violence against women is still a planetary epidemic](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/)
, that 25% of women live in countries with
[highly restrictive abortion laws,](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/619/abortion-laws-worldwide)
and, here at home, the United States is the
[only industrialized nation without paid parental leave](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/26/u-s-lacks-mandated-paid-parental-leave/)
!! It is a strike to remind our country, and the world, that freedom is universal only when each person is free and able to participate to the fullest of their abilities.
As the organizers have said, A Day Without a Woman is ""to highlight the economic power and significance that women have in the U.S. and global economies, while calling attention to the economic injustices women and gender-nonconforming people continue to face.""
What you can do
1. READ the
[asks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12y2bL3azD3wav52IXq9-14nKtstMf5oR8Ts2HICbNUU/edit)
of the Woman's March
and how to strike: organizers are asking participants to perform no labor (paid or unpaid) if they are able. If you don't have the luxury to do this, you can still participate in other ways by boycotting sexist companies, wearing red to show your support, and simply resisting gender roles.
2. SEND
[a letter](http://laist.com/2017/03/03/strike_letter.php)
to your boss to let them know why you won't be at work.
3. FIND

,"Gov. Cuomo: Don't Let My Taxes Go to Trump!
Ask Governor Cuomo to Suspend Financial Transfers to Washington Until the Threat to Sanctuary Cities is Removed and Donald Trump Releases His Tax Returns
The United States has a long history of tax strikes used as a device by the people to intervene when the government oversteps its power. From the Boston Tea Party to Henry David Thoreau, from the Suffragettes to today?s War Tax Resistors, one thing has been made clear: Money is power and ""We the People"" know where our power lies as the primary financial bread-winners of this nation.
The citizens of this country contribute 80% of the annual federal budget through payment of federal income tax.

to suspend the transfer of the state?s taxes to Washington until the threat to sanctuary cities is removed. We are asking Governor Cuomo, who has been incredibly

. Established as part of the Dodd-Frank Bill, the CFPB set to rein in the predatory lending practices of banks that made it easy for borrowers to get loans and credit that they couldn't afford.  The CFPB now requires banks to verify the income and application information listed by applicants.
The CFPB also receives and investigates consumer complaints, having addressed over one million complaints since 2011. The bureau has also returned over $11.7 billion to American families. BILLIONS! $3.6 billion of that was direct restitution, while the other  $7.7 billion was made up of cancelled and reduced debt and other financial relief.
The Bill is currently in the House Financial Services Committee being reviewed. Let's call the head of the committee, its members, and our representatives and tell them to put American interests ahead of the interest of Wall Street and Big Banks by voting against the bill to abolish the CFPB!

and I'm with the group 2 Hours a Week.
I'm calling to ask Senator/Representative _
__
to vote AGAINST the proposed bill to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau reined in and out of control and predatory financial industry, returned billions of dollars to American families. Abolishing this critical entity would once again put Americans at risk of being taken advantage of by big banks and Wall Street by putting profits over people. This could also ultimately set us up for another financial crisis. I'm asking that you protect the American people and vote no against this bill.

Republicans unveiled their ?

? to replace the Affordable Healthcare Act, and it is so bad that the American Medical Association, the AARP, the American Hospital Association, and

Basic economics says that costs will rise for everyone but the
[very rich](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/upshot/gop-health-bill-would-cut-funding-for-poor-and-taxes-on-rich.html)
under this proposal. Those with insurance through their employer will also be affected.
The legislation was hastily cobbled together in the last few weeks and jammed through a second house committee vote at 4am on Thursday morning.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not analyzed the new proposal yet, which means committees have been working without an estimate of how many people would stand to gain or lose coverage and how much repeal-and-replace would cost. This is not the way government should work.
Act now. The repeal of the ACA is a campaign promise and Republicans are doggedly determined to deliver on their disastrous plan whose primary beneficiaries are?you guessed it, the rich, who would pay even less for healthcare.
What you can do
1. CALL 844-6-RESIST
and tell your Senators and Representatives to vote against the Republican American Healthcare Act; the votes are set to take place in the next couple of weeks.
When you dial the above number you will be automatically connected to your representatives sequentially--no need to redial. Ask them to speak out and demand that the votes be delayed until the CBO completes and releases its analysis.
2. SUBMIT
a personal story.  If you have a personal story about how you have been impacted by the ACA, share it. You can submit it in writing

Our fight to save our health care - hell, our fight to save all of our civil liberties - has emotional roots in the hard fought battles and well deserved successes of ACT UP, the legendary group of grassroots activists fighting to stay alive during the AIDS crisis in the 1980's.
As long as we stick together in fighting for the same greater goal, our individual fights can take many forms - within the political system, through civil disobedience, creative resistance, and more. By learning from those who came before us we will be better prepared to continue this fight and make the changes we want to see in the world.

,"ACA Repeal: Transfer of Wealth to the Wealthy
Let's be clear: Repeal-and-replace is a
[giant transfer of wealth from the lowest-income Americans to the highest-income Americans](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-taxes-idUSKBN16K2G6)
. No surprise then who is pushing for the repeal: those at the top of the economic ladder.
There were two tax increases levied on the wealthiest of Americans to help pay for the ACA. Trumpcare would reverse those, meaning that:
People making $200,000 - $999,999 a year will get a sizable tax cut.
60% of the money saved will go to those making $1 million a year or more.
The tax repeal would solely benefit wealthy Americans because the taxes were imposed only on the wealthiest.
The House Budget Committee votes on the bill this Thursday March 16th.
Only FOUR Republican ""NO"" votes are needed to stop this bill in committee. Let's call those Republicans who are on the fence.
What you can do
Sign up for a one-hour shift at a rally at your member of Congress' office this Thursday and Friday through MoveOn.org.
CALL the Republican members of the House Budget Committee and let them know you are against the ACA repeal bill. Those highlighted have voiced concern and/or opposition; call them first if you only have a few minutes.

,"ACTION 92 Medicaid Expansion Ends by 2020: Reject the current Republican Healthcare plan!
The Republicans' current health plan will federally defund Medicaid expansion in 2020, to the point that many states would likely find continuing it unsustainable.  Not coincidentally, this occurs after the mid-term elections.
As of now, Medicaid accounts for 14 million of the 24 million who would lose insurance.
Who benefits from the ACA Medicaid expansion?
Those in low-wage jobs that do not offer health insurance?like waiters and waitresses, sales clerks, cooks, and home health aides. Economically speaking, not to mention ethically, this is a nightmare for the working backbone of America.
Speak up today, Thursday, to decry this offensive legislation.

1. CHECK

,"Don't Worry - Congress Will Still Have A Cushy Health Plan
In the midst of this ACA repeal debacle, have you asked yourself what kind of healthcare our members of congress (MoC) and their staff receive?
Since 2014, they too have to
[buy their insurance](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/03/17/members-of-congress-health-insurance)
through the ACA's health exchanges.  However, 72% of the cost is subsidized by the federal government. That means,
MoC and staff pay only 28% of their annual healthcare premiums out-of-pocket.
This subsidy was arranged so that those in Congress would still have low-cost healthcare similar to what they formerly received under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB).  It follows that, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, members of Congress would be able to return to the federal plan that they, like millions of federal employees,
[were so fond of](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/on-health-care-well-have-what-congress-is-having)

Hi
I am calling to ask Rep ____ to vote against the ACA repeal bill this Thursday in the House Bvote. I am alarmed at what it will take away from average Americans like myself, in terms of healthcare, and what it will give to wealthy Americans in terms of tax cuts.  The repeal will take away health coverage from millions and will be especially detrimental to the elderly, and the poorest of Americans. I will take into account how you vote on this, come re-election time.",2017-06-06 23:52:03.048034,,,Don't Worry - Congress Will Still Have A Cushy Health Plan,Parsed www.2hoursaweek.org for training data,,[],2hoursaweek.org,"['97', 'anti_trump']",['action'],http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/don-t-worry-congress-will-still-have-a-cushy-health-plan
,"House Vote is Tonight on the ACA Repeal
Hello!
The House is expected to hold a late night vote on the Affordable Care Act this evening. If the legislation does poorly in the House, it's less likely to pass in the Senate.
This is a Republican partisan fight, purely based on trying to push a campaign promise through. It is not an attempt to improve healthcare in America. Meanwhile, DJT had been

Take 5 minutes to call your representative today. If you've already called, call again. Ask your friends to call too. <3
What you can do
1. DIAL
your reps and tell them you oppose the American Healthcare Act (that's the name of the Republicans' plan).

OREGON ACTION
Urge State Lawmakers to Enact Corporate Tax Reform
Oregon is currently facing a $1.8 billion deficit. At the same time, corporations in Oregon pay one of the lowest tax rates in the country. There was a ballot initiative in November that would have changed that and ensured adequate state funding, but not surprisingly, it was heavily opposed by corporations and lobbyists. It is now the Oregon state legislature's turn to fix this problem. They are currently working with the business community on a bill, but it is not big or bold enough. Corporations are still calling the shots and Oregonians will suffer the burden. Oregon cannot be a progressive state and stand up to the Trumpublican agenda with adequate funding - this budget gap affects everything we do here.
WRITE/CALL
the Oregon
[House Committee on Revenue](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Committees/HREV/Overview)
and your individual Oregon House & Senate representatives and put pressure on them to enact meaningful corporate tax reform.

,"Read Closer, Look Deeper
This is a reactive time with news on many fronts. Here is our challenge: to read between the lines, to think critically, and at the same time to see the bigger picture.
Thursday night the US carried out a missile strike against Syria in response to the Syrian governments chemical weapons attack.  Decisive response or military theatre, consequential action or distraction from US domestic conflicts and the Russia investigation? Hone your critical reading skills and watch closely how the story will skew over the next 36 hours.
Here are a few things to know:
In 2013, Trump's message to Obama was ""
[to stay out of Syria](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/04/522627064/on-the-record-president-trump-vs-private-citizen-trump-on-syria)
"" and warned of the immense monetary cost of such a maneuver.
Trump's first budget proposed
[to increase military spending by $54 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/us/politics/trump-budget-military.html)
and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount.
In Thursday night's attack, the US launched 59 tomahawk missiles with each costing about
[$850,000 a piece](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/politics/tomahawk-missiles-explainer/)
, meaning cost of missiles alone was at least $50 million.
The Pentagon
[warned Russia ahead of the attacks](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/04/what-is-al-shayrat-military-airfield/522249/)
knowing when they did that that Russian authorities may well have alerted the Assad regime.
Russian assets stationed at al-Shayrat since at least late 2015, were reportedly avoided in the strike.
Before the strike, the planned meeting between Secretary of State Tillerson and Putin had been expected to be
[dominated by the investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/world/middleeast/airstikes-syria-trump-russia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)
into Russia?s cyberattacks and the interference in the presidential election on Mr. Trump?s behalf.
Several lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, have called on Trump to
[seek congressional authorization](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/327745-cruz-trump-should-make-case-for-military-action-in-syria)
for military action against the regime of Syrian leader Bashar Assad.

,"Less Mulder, More Scully
For those not acquainted with the X-Files, today's email title simply means:
exercise a healthy dose of skepticism
. Especially when it comes to mainstream media and how they report and frame current events.
Last week's US strike on Syria elicited so many laudatory responses from major news outlets on the right and the left, that only the
[political satirists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB2_t-7eh40)
seemed to report on it with a clear head.  As a recent
[video](http://www.vox.com/2017/4/3/15163170/strikethrough-comedians-satire-trump-misinformation)
pointed out, satirists are much better equipped to cover this administration, because they have a very low tolerance for misinformation and deceit aka the b.s. Meanwhile  major news outlets and traditional journalists feel obliged to take the administration's oft absurd statements and whims seriously.
While Thursday's strikes were glorified in mainstream media, it's a good time to ask:
what did the strikes actually achieve? Did they change anything on the ground?
The answer is
a
[decisive ""No""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/warplanes-return-to-syrian-town-devastated-by-chemical-attack/2017/04/08/38a5d8cc-1bdc-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.01c7e4099911)
but you won't find these answers on mainstream news coverage. Time to look elsewhere for critical news reporting and time to ask our representatives and senators about where they stand on military engagement, not just in Syria but
[everywhere that Trump has threatened over twitter](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-threatens-twitter-solve-the-problem-north-korea)
.  We do not want more war, and we will not praise any such actions towards it because as one

says,
""we have a president who feeds off praise, and he just got a lot of it for bombing someone, and that should make everyone very, very worried.""
What you can do
1. CALL
your members of congress and senators now.
(844-6-RESIST) 844-673-7478
Tell them you are against further engagement in Syria and other countries that Trump has threatened
. Congress must force consideration of an Authorization for Use of Military Force, and members of Congress should vote ""no"" and halt Trump's march toward war.

Hi Rep/Sen.
__
Let's be clear: There's no doubt that Bashar Assad is a brutal dictator who has slaughtered his own people and is complicit in the use of chemical weapons. But this is no humanitarian mission.
These are missiles ordered by a flailing president with plummeting approval ratings, trying to show how ""tough"" he can be
. The result will likely be increased suffering for the Syrian people. And this unilateral U.S. attack could possibly even draw in Russia and Iran, which have been close partners of the Assad regime. The U.S. cannot bomb its way to peace.

,"Don't Forget About Russia: The New Nunes
Between Syria, the budget, and rumblings of Bannon being on the outs, it's easy to forget about the hanging thread that could very well take down the Trump regime: Russia.
Last week, when Devin Nunes recused himself from leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Trump's dealings with Russia, many members of the resistance were quick to cheer. Don't celebrate too soon and don't get comfortable.

[Representative Mike Conaway](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522879293/meet-mike-conaway-gop-congressman-now-overseeing-houses-russia-probe)
,
has replaced Republican Representative Devin Nunes as the lead on the House Intelligence Committees investigation into Russian interference
in the 2016 Presidential elections.
While Democratic and fellow committee member, Rep. Adam Schiff sees Conaway taking over the helm as a ""fresh opportunity"" there isn't much reason to believe Conaway will be any less biased than Nunes. Conaway compared Putin's opinions of Trump and Clinton to a college football rivalry during the FBI Russia Hearing and also compared potential Russian interference to Mexican celebrities helping Clinton GOTV. This kind of cavalier attitude toward a clear attempt by a foreign enemy to undermine our democracy makes it clear that a thorough and rigorous investigation it is not.

1. Us Congress Needs To Examine Donald Trump?s Tax Returns
Call your Congress member using
[www.cluckyourrep.com](http://www.cluckyourrep.com)
or 202-224-3121 and tell them: NO EXCUSES, EXAMINE TRUMP?S TAX RETURNS! No Tax reform until all of the president?s tax returns are public. We must know his conflicts of interest, and how he?ll personally benefit from tax code changes.
2. Your State Must Require Tax Returns To Run For Office
Call your
[State Senator](http://www.goo.gl/7A7q8R)
and tell them: NO ONE GETS ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY so no future president can get away with hiding their conflicts of interest, and no candidate can get on the 2020 ballot without releasing their tax returns. More than half of states have already introduced this bill - has yours?
3. Your City Taxpayers Shouldn?t Pay For Trump Tower
Do you have Trump property in your city? Contact your mayor and demand: GET OUR COPS OUT!  Local police are wasting millions in taxpayer-funded overtime Protecting Trump?s property. That?s the job of the Secret Service and Trump?s own security. (In NYC? Tweet @NYCMayorsOffice and call 311).

What?s the Antiquities act? Though it may sound like a law that protects old furniture, it is one of our nation's most important conservation tools.  And it has been used to safeguard and protect federal lands, sites of cultural and historical importance, and scientific interest. These national monuments are then overseen and cared for by federal agencies.
Though Zinke?s review will be limited to monuments designated since 1996, and those totaling 100,000 acres or more, it sets a startling precedent. In undermining the Antiquities Act, the Trump administration is tearing away the longest-standing piece of legislation protecting our nation?s natural heritage.

,"Our Commitment to the Earth is Not Up For Debate
Trump is set to announce on Tuesday whether he will pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord. The climate accord went into effect on Nov 4th, 2016, and primarily aims to keep global average temperature ?well below 2?C above pre-industrial levels.?  To put that into perspective, the planet
[has warmed](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)
about 1 degree Celsius already, according to NASA.
Why does he want to pull out of it?  In order to bolster US fossil fuel industries. Here's the problem:

.
Trump wants to saddle us with decades-old policy that is not only bad for the environment but bad for our economy. Institutional investors have urged Trump to stick with the accord because mitigating climate change is not only good for the environment but also for safeguarding investments,
[which could leave the country entirely as they have done in other instances of poor policy decisions](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/23/516895101/when-argentina-elected-a-populist-president-some-companies-left-the-country)

Hello, I believe that the firing of FBI Director James Comey was a blatant attempt to suppress the truth as more and more evidence surfaced as a result of recent hearings on the collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.
There MUST be a fully independent, non-partisan 9/11-style commission, with subpoena power, to investigate Trump and Russia, and it must be assembled immediately! Comey should be immediately called to testify in a open hearing about the status of the investigation at the time of his firing.
The Senate cannot approve any new FBI director who will be under the thumb of the White House.

,"We Can't Confirm A New FBI Director Without This
The scandal over Trump and his campaign?s ties to Russia gets weirder and more disturbing by the day. As this sequence of events unravels, we will be taking you through the next actionable steps.
Assistant AG Rod Rosenstein has a reputation for being non-partisan. The letter attributed to Rosenstein recommending FBI director James Comey, on which basis Trump claims to be acting, seems very suspect. This means one of several things: Rosenstein either isn't as non-partisan as he previously appeared; he's taking the fall; or there's something else going on.
All of this means we need to hear Rosenstein's testimony as well as Sessions. Immediately.

AB 1520, which will help raise 1 million children in California out of poverty. The bill got through its first committee vote with unanimous support, but still has a ways to go before it?s passed.
CALL
your CA Assembly Member and tell them you support it!
2. Urge Attorney General Xavier Becerra to Join State Investigations into Exxon
. Exxon Mobil's own scientists told executives about the corporation's role in causing climate change as far back as the 1970's. Instead of acting on that information, Exxon funded a decades-long disinformation campaign that helped stall meaningful policy, while profiting from a product it knew was driving the world closer to disaster. MA & NY are investigating what Exxon knew and what it told its shareholders and the public - and they've started to raise serious questions. CA can be a leader in this movement too. It's time the state join the investigations.

2 FLORIDA ACTIONS
1. Call on Governor Scott to veto
Speaker Corcoran's Conforming Bill, which forces local school districts to subsidize charter schools, while exempting those charter schools from the requirements public schools must follow. This is not good for our children. It only serves to line the pockets of the charter school industry. Governor Scott still has the chance to veto. He and Speaker Corcoran have been feuding, so it won't take much to get him to veto the bill - let's do it!

2. Help get Florida Rights Restoration on the ballot
. It would restore voting rights to 1.6 million formerly incarcerated people in Florida. Felon voting rights have a bigger impact on elections than voter ID laws, and this could literally be the difference between a win and a loss in 2018 and 2020. It needs 700,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot by January and it needs people on the ground in Florida to gather those signatures by hand.

Have you been reading the news? Trump is not a president we can entrust with

let alone with the appointment of a new FBI director. It's been reported that AG Sessions and Deputy AG Rosenstein have interviewed
[8 candidates,](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-15/eight-candidates-quizzed-for-fbi-chief-amid-uproar-over-comey)
with no further interviews scheduled.
Trump has been urged to not make a political appointment of the FBI director.  Past candidates historically have had the unanimous support of both parties, with only one dissenting vote ever.
This is because the director of the FBI is not a political post, and should be someone who does not have a partisan background
. Not to mention someone who will continue to carry out the Russia investigation to it's fullest.
Keep a close watch on Thursday, when Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein is set to

,"ACTION 138:  Keep Your Eye On The Ball of the American Health Care Act (AHCA)
Don't lose sight of what's happening with Trumpcare. Two weeks ago, House Republicans took the first steps toward stripping healthcare from millions of Americans and making it exceedingly difficult for millions more to get healthcare in the future by passing the American Health Care Act (AHCA).
[This past Monday](http://2hoursaweek.org/actions/some-issues-are-just-not-partisan)
we told you which Republicans supported it and what comes next. Today we'll explain more what's in this bill, and what is happening next with it.

Lifetime limits for certain types of treatment (Hit your max for chemo? Oh well!)
Changes that will result in the decrease of employer provided insurance.

Keep your eyes open for a report out of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) the week of May 22.
What's Next?
It ain't over yet! The bill still has to pass the Senate. While it has to clear some hurdles (like the
[Byrd Rule](https://mic.com/articles/171952/what-is-the-byrd-rule-congressional-procedure-could-kill-trump-s-health-care-plan#.9RqvTpNK7)

A committee with members from both the House and Senate will be formed as an bureaucratic outcropping of this rewrite, and they will reconcile the differences between the new and old versions and pass the bill.

A
[new poll](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/334117-poll-majority-believe-comey-fired-to-hinder-russia)
shows that most Americans believe that Trump fired Comey in order to hinder an investigation into his ties to Russia.
The appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to this investigation is a great sign that public pressure is working.
Don't let this recent success distract from the real goal: Congress must launch an independent commission
.
[Here's why](https://www.standupamerica.com/five-reasons-still-need-independent-commission/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=partner)
:
The special counsel?s job is limited to criminal activity
. While the special counsel will announce whether there are criminal charges, an independent commission would release a detailed report of what happened, who knew what when, and what steps are needed to prevent future interference in our elections and hold Trump accountable.
There needs to be a staff dedicated to this
. Congress has not dedicated the staff and resources necessary for its investigative committees to find the truth and prevent future interference.
Independence from this administration
. The special counsel appointed by the deputy attorney general sits within the Justice Department and falls within Trump?s chain of command.

,"Flunking Healthcare: AHCA's CBO Score
The CBO analysis of the AHCA (Trumpcare) comes out this afternoon
.
There is a lot of maneuvering happening to make this bill politically palatable and passable, none of which take into consideration the effects it will have on actual people, whose healthcare is at risk.
The House Republicans who voted for the AHCA (Trumpcare) bill on May 4th are so worried about the
[CBO [Congressional Budget Office] analysis](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/cbo-interview-ahca-effects/525420/)
of their bill that they've already announced a
[media blitz](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/republican-group-runs-ad-to-defend-obamacare-repeal-from-cbo-score/article/2623868)
to coincide with the release of the report today. Speaker Ryan has taken the unusual step of holding onto the bill, rather than passing it onto the Senate, for fear of a bad CBO score.
Why should we pay attention to the CBO analysis?
The bill passed the House after dramatic changes were made to it. An earlier CBO score became obsolete, but no final score was ever issued.
It's possible the last minute additions to the AHCA mentioned above will end up
[costing more money](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/18/15661290/house-health-care-bill-ahca-cbo-problems)
than it saves.
Republicans are hoping to pass the AHCA in the Senate, where it will go next, under the budget reconciliation process, which would allow it to pass with only 51 votes?hence without any Democratic votes.
House Republicans plan to re-write the bill to meet needed reductions if it doesn't receive a good score, and then vote on it again!
In short, Republicans are, yet again, determined to score a party win at the expense of the American healthcare system.
What you can do
1. WATCH
for the CBO report when it comes out this afternoon. It will not only tell us how much money the AHCA will save and/or cost but also how many Americans will lose their health coverage as a result. These are important numbers to know in our fight for healthcare.

Last week, the Federal Communications Commission
[voted to start repealing the 2015 network neutrality rules](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-overturn-net-neutrality/101828412/)
. The rules ensure that internet users can access the online content and services of their choosing without interference from ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter.
What exactly is net neutrality? The Harvard Business Review
[defines](https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-tangled-web-of-net-neutrality-and-regulation)
the principles of net neutrality well:
""...a broadband internet provider should not block, slow, or otherwise unfairly discriminate against any websites or online services.""

means a level playing field where the small one-woman shop in Omaha has just as good a shot at drumming up business online as the big box store headquartered in a tax haven.
Repealing net neutrality rules isn't a job generator - it's a job killer.
Newly appointed FCC Chair Ajit Pai wants people to believe that internet providers are over-regulated. That consumer protections are hindering the development of business. That we should trust big cable companies not to discriminate against web services without oversight (though they are already doing just that).
[Don't fall for](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/332342-john-oliver-roasts-the-fccs-plan-to-curb-net-neutrality)

. Pai is not interested in keeping an open and free internet - he's interested in creating a market open and free of hurdles for the cable lobby. We can't let their unmitigated greed parse the internet into slow and fast lanes.

[Protecting Our Democracy Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/356)
. Since Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has refused to bring this bill up on the floor,
[Democrats have filed a discharge petition](https://5calls.org/issue/recywt9vEUNwAsZOo)

2 CALIFORNIA ACTIONS
Please
[call your state senator](http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/)
and ask them to vote yes on SB49, SB50, SB51, and SB775
. These bills have a real chance of passage but need grassroots momentum.
1. Vote yes to Preserve California
Time after time, California has led the way on the environment. And now we have a chance to do it again, with a landmark set of bills that would protect our air, water, wildlife and health against the Trump administration's reckless pro-polluter agenda ? and serve as a model for other states to do the same. These groundbreaking bills are called Preserve California (SB49, SB50, SB51) and they're moving through our State Senate currently.
2. Get California off of Fossil Fuels
A landmark bill has been introduced into the State Senate which offers a clear path to getting California off of fossil fuels. It's a powerful and thoughtful piece of legislation and needs everyone's support to get the super majority required to become law. SB775 upgrades California?s cap and trade system to make it more effective at reaching our ambitious climate goals and more equitable for California residents and businesses.
UPCOMING ELECTIONS
Turnout will make the difference in these surprisingly competitive races that could flip seats in Congress, so pitch in by phone banking, donating, volunteering and spreading the word.
CA - Vote.
GA
- Democrat Jon Ossoff nearly pulled an upset, coming in first in a very red district. Now he advances to the runoff, where the vote will be tighter.
SC
- Another surprisingly competitive race in a red district can help flip the balance of power.
VA

,"Townhall Time
This is the week folks!  Your senators and representatives are in their home districts, so make the most of it and make your voices heard at their offices and townhall meetings.
You say you're in a blue state, so what does it matter?
No better time to re-affirm that your representative is serving your best interests on major issues like healthcare, social services, climate change, and the on-going Russia investigation, among others. If you don't know where they stand on these issues (and how they will vote back in D.C.), a townhall is a great place to find out. Let them know you are engaged and paying attention to their actions.
Your state is blue, but is your district?
Just because your state went blue in the presidential election doesn't mean all districts in it are blue. Have friends or family in a red district? Now is the time when they can have a real impact.
See if you or anyone you know is represented by someone on the list below
. These are Republicans who we want to be in touch with about both the AHCA/Trumpcare bill as well as the Russia investigation.  All it takes is a few minutes to check for yourself and for your friends and family.
What you can do
1. CHECK
if any of the Reps and Senators below represent you and reach out! Most of them are refusing to hold in-person townhalls for fear of their constituents. We've linked below to any information if there is one, or a tele-townhall sign up, petitions asking for one, or simply their facebook pages for direct contact.
