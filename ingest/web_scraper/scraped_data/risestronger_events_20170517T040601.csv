We're rallying because the oil industry has captured our democracy, and we're going to take it back!  \n\n\nMARCH AND RALLY INFORMATION:\n\n\nWHEN: Saturday May 20\n\nTIME: 12 Noon to 3pm\n\nWHERE: The Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion\n\nLOCATION: 16TH St. and H St., Sacramento\n\n\nURL coming soon:  www.OilMoneyOut.org \n\n\nHere's why we're rallying: \n\n\nIn the past year, the oil industry spent an historic 36.1 million dollars to lobby California lawmakers. Over the past 6 years, the industry has spent 122 million, more than any other interest group. This spending spree has paid huge dividends for these companies, allowing them to quash or neuter any meaningful legislation that might significantly curb their power to drill and pollute. This is particularly significant as during this time, the state of California performed independent studies which had notable findings on the toxicity of oil operations and made strong recommendations to protect public health, none of which have been implemented or addressed, leaving the general public vulnerable to contamination and toxic exposure.\n\n\nAs guardians of the public trust, the lack of action from our governor and our legislators our to protect the public is unacceptable.   \n\n\nThis past year, several environmental groups tried to push forward bills in the legislature to stop some of the worst practices of the oil industry, such as the use of oil wastewater laden with toxic chemicals in crop irrigation, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get sponsors for those bills.  Supposedly environmentally friendly legislators control the legislature and the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion, and proudly portray themselves as cutting edge trendsetters in the fight for a clean energy future. But the reality is deeply contradictory. The record shows that elected officials in California are almost completely unwilling to take on the oil industry.\n\n\nTo see how this is playing out, one needs to look no further than our Governor, Jerry Brown, who claims that he is boldly taking action on climate change and is an environmental champion. However, this is the same governor who has taken over 10 million for himself and his initiatives from the fossil fuel industry in his last two terms in office and has fired his own regulators - at the request of the oil industry - for doing their job in trying to protect public health and the environment.   \n\n\nLeaders can\xe2\x80\x99t take the oil industry\xe2\x80\x99s money and do their bidding, and be a climate or environmental champions at the same time.   We need champions looking out for the people, our communities, and the climate, not the profits of the oil industry which is engaging in demonstrably bad practices. Until we stop the flow of money into our elected officials pockets, nothing is going to change.   \n\n\nTHE SOLUTION\t\n\n\nUntil oil money stops poisoning our democracy, the people of the state of California will continue to be poisoned by industry practices. California\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders need to make their primary allegiance clear: is it to the oil industry or the health and safety of their constituents? The days of having it both ways have to come to an end. \n\n\nWe will force enough state elected officials to stop taking these toxic dollars and prioritize public health over oil the interests of the industry, and finally break the logjam in Sacramento and put an end to the most toxic industry practices. \n\n\nOrganizations Supporting This Campaign: Rootskeeper, Food & Water Watch, Center for Biological Diversity, California for Progress, Courage Campaign, CREDO, The Other 98%, Californians Against Fracking, and Progressive Democrats of America.""",16th St and H St Sacramento CA,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.5803065,-121.4843092",Oil Money Out March and Rally,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,,['https://facebook.com/events/277604746028035'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/oil-money-out-march-and-rally,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

"Jul 2, 2017 12:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  3:00 PM MDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

"Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

Following a year which found them calling out the Maricopa County Recorder's Office quite frequently in the press, in 2017 they will go for broke, sitting the new Recorder himself up on stage and letting him have it in person!  \nThe evening will begin with cocktails and a specially created menu featuring desert soul food before we sit down for the main course: the man himself, Adrian Fontes. The Marines may have toughened him, and a contentious race may have hardened him, but is he ready for what a star-studded panel of roasters will bring? \nEverybody is jumping on board for this, too! Joining emcee Richie Taylor and an already star-filled lineup including Rep Ken Clark and Robbie Sherwood will be Secretary of State Michele Reagan!  \nThe roast, which will be held at FABRiC (132 East Sixth Street, Tempe, AZ 85281), formerly the Tempe Performing Arts Center, will be catered by Chef Appolon Lewis in conjunction with San Carlos Apache educator Twila Cassadore and Tarra Lazos Creative and promises to be the highlight of the 2017 fundraising season.

"Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

And this region is home to Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, the two richest people on the planet. In spite of all this tremendous wealth, workers and poor people, especially those from communities of color, are struggling to get by. \nOur state's regressive tax structure leaves social services, schools, and public transportation woefully underfunded. This is only made worse by extreme income inequality and skyrocketing rents in Seattle.\nWe need to tax the rich so that big business and the wealthy begin paying their fair share! In 2015, a person making $21,000 or less paid almost 17% of their income in taxes while the richest 1% paid a pitiful 2.4%. \nJoin my office and the Trump-Proof Seattle Coalition at our town hall to talk about a City ordinance to tax Seattle's rich!

Lectures cover the history of people's movements and corporate power, and the dramatic organizing over the last decade in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Colorado, Washington, and Oregon by communities confronting agribusiness, the oil and gas industry, corporate hegemony over worker rights, and others. \nIncluded with enrollment in the Democracy School is a 300 plus-page notebook of background reading material.\nIn Boulder County and many other counties in Colorado, we are facing impending oil and gas drilling as our moratoriums end. Join us for Democracy School as we learn more about how to continue the fight for local control over fracking and other issues in our communities. \nLearn more about Democracy School in this short video from the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund:    \nQuestions?

The Constitution was written by our forefathers to ensure that WE THE PEOPLE have rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  \nThe Declaration of Independence showcases the reasons that America was born.  It states:\n""When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature\'s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \xe2\x80\x94 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \xe2\x80\x94 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.""\nBut lately, WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES have felt that our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are somewhat shaky.  We go to work everyday, come home and watch the news, discuss what we see and what we feel is important, and then contact our government representatives who often ignore our letters, calls and even face to face meetings.  They are supposed to represent us, but do they know that? It seems that they are only listening to people like the Koch Brothers and others with plenty of money to spread around.\nUnited Voice of the Eagle is a celebration of ""WE THE PEOPLE"".  It is us, reminding our government that WE THE PEOPLE are in charge.  WE THE PEOPLE want representation in Congress, in the White House, and in all the State Houses as well.  We gather to declare what WE THE PEOPLE want in hopes that our representatives will hear us at last and realize that they are shortchanging the very people they are supposed to represent.  \nSimply stated, WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA wish to be heard and listened to. We will not be silenced.

Mental health is suffering for many people under the relentless assaults on our democracy and the daily insanity from our government. It's hard to fill your cup of hope sometimes, and that is what this event is designed to do. There is strength in knowing that you are not alone. Music can fill us in ways that sustain us when it's hard to keep fighting for what we believe in. Everyone needs to see light in the darkness. Let's be that light for one night. \n\n\nWhat to bring: \n\nMason or similar glass jar\n\nSmall candle or LED electric candle\n\nAs many people as you can to participate!\n\n* Optional: Sign with the name of your organization and contact info\n\n* Optional: your camera or cell phone\n\n\nThank so much for helping make this night of peaceful resistance happen! Here's the plan:\n\n\nWe are going to use light and sound to bring hope to anyone feeling the progressive blues. To do this, you will need to carry a jar and your candle in a purse or pocket. Part of the fun of a Flash Mob is the surprise, so we want to make sure that your candle and jar are hidden until the time is right. The same goes with any posters you are bringing. \n\n\nHave fun at First Friday! You don't need to arrive at 6, just make sure you are somewhere mingled in the crowd by 8. Set a vibration timer on your phone to alert you at dusk, which is 8:32 pm. When your alarm goes off, light your candle (or turn it on) in your mason jar and walk quietly towards the street directly in front of the Hamburger in, facing towards Old Bag of Nails. A soloist will be singing to bring everyone to the correct spot. The people not in Vocal Resistance will form a ring around the choir holding their candles, as Vocal Resistance performs. If you have a sign, now is the time to get it out! We will stand silently around the choir until the songs are finished, then clap or cheer. Then we disperse back out into the crowd, and that's it! You have demonstrated that there are progressive voices in our community, and they are beautiful. The Resistance can be powerful, peaceful, and inspiring. \n\n::::\n\nHere is the official info from First Friday's event ont May 5.

The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions.  If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.  \nOur goals for this march are simple:\n-Congressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests, or an independent investigation must be established;\n-As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;\n-Donald Trump should release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;\n-If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.\n-Therefore, we call for a March for Truth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that American citizens want answers.\nThe legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President.

It will be an opportunity to meet and connect with others in our community to discuss GMO's and to begin taking personal control of our food and exploring alternative options that are available to us. \n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nWHY DO WE MARCH?\n\nResearch studies have shown that Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s genetically-modified (GMO) foods can lead to serious health conditions such as the development of cancer tumors, infertility and birth defects. \n\n\nFor too long, Monsanto has been the benefactor of corporate subsidies and political favoritism. Organic and small farmers suffer losses while Monsanto continues to forge its monopoly over the world\xe2\x80\x99s food supply, including exclusive patenting rights over seeds and genetic makeup. Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s GMO seeds are harmful to the environment; for example, scientists have indicated that they have caused colony collapse among the world\xe2\x80\x99s bee population.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOLUTIONS ADVOCATED?\n\n- Vote with your wallet by buying organic and boycotting Monsanto-owned companies that use GMOs in their products. \n\n- Labeling of GMOs so that consumers can make those informed decisions easier. \n\n- Calling for further scientific research on the health effects of GMOs. \n\n- Holding Monsanto executives and Monsanto-supporting politicians accountable through direct communication, grassroots journalism, social media, etc. \n\n- Continuing to inform the public about Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. \n\n- Taking to the streets to show the world and Monsanto that we won\xe2\x80\x99t take these injustices quietly. \n\n\nWe will not stand for cronyism. We will not stand for poison. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we March Against Monsanto.\n\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION ON GMOs\n\nFor fantastic information and explanations on GMOs, including what products in Australia contain GMOs, please check out the following websites:\n\n\nYouTube documentary 'The World According to Monsanto':  https://youtu.be/87qrTXZaXkk\n\n\nhttp://www.madge.org.au/what-genetically-modified-gm-food\n\n\nhttp://www.march-against-monsanto.com/home/\n\n\nhttp://downtoearthmother.com/2013/06/19/how-to-avoid-gmo-foods-in-australia/\n\n\nhttp://safefoodfoundation.org/""",Sydney Town Hall ,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=-33.8731575,151.2061157",March Against Monsanto - Sydney,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Sydney Town Hall,['https://facebook.com/events/389192101434052'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-against-monsanto-sydney,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

As members of March for Public Education, we aim to advance policy and recursively address issues of: equity, inclusion, accountability, a well-funded institution and the right to organize.\n\n\nOUR PRINCIPLES\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must fight for equity. All students should enter the classroom on equal footing. Special educators, social workers, school psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, occupational therapists, and countless others are critical to creating an equitable school culture. Striving toward this ideal is the only way to create a meritocratic environment that is fair for all students.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must strive to create a safe space for all. In this regard, schools have the recursive responsibility to combat racism, sexism, ableism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public education empowers children to discover their desires, passions and potential. In turn, children become tenacious adults who are critical thinkers, involved citizens and lifelong learners. The arts, humanities, mathematics, sciences and physical education are equally vital in developing the whole child.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must be held accountable in the fight for equity. Accountability can include thoughtful standards and purposeful testing. These structures should strive to help schools provide a better education to students and should coincide with intentional professional development for teachers.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A well-funded public education is a right of all children, regardless of their intersectional identities. For profit educational institutions and their fundamental motivation for capital are incongruous in helping children realize their full identity.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Faculty and staff have the right and responsibility to organize. As members of the institution that is public education, stakeholders must challenge societal paradigms on behalf of students and the community.'",", Washington, DC","https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.9071923,-77.0368707",March For Public Education- Tentative Date,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Washington,['https://facebook.com/events/254445494966564'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-public-education-tentative-date,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

On Guantanamo, he said he wants to keep the prison open and ""load it up with some bad dudes"".  Now, more than ever, is the time for us to stand against these crimes against humanity. President Obama broke his promise - 41 men remain imprisoned at Guantanamo. A powerful movement against torture and illegal detention is their best chance for justice.\n\n\nFifteen years ago, the United States brought the first detainees to Guantanamo Bay. The detention center has since then become a place of torture and shame. Released detainees claimed that waterboarding, sexual humiliation, and forced drugging were used on prisoners. Six detainees have committed suicide. \n\n\nSince January 11 2001, 779 men have been sent to Guantanamo Bay without trial and have been jailed without ever having been charged with any crime. As of March 2017, 41 prisoners remain locked up. A horrific torture prison created under George Bush remains up and running under President Trump, despite Barack Obama\'s infinite promises to the American people that he would shut it down. \n\n\nWikileaks produced documents from the US government stating that at least 150 Afghanis and Pakistanis detained in Guantanamo were never a risk at all, were brought in by mistake or for no clear reason, and then were held without due process for years. These innocent people include a camera man from Al Jazeera and a 70 year old with dementia with ""no reason on record"" for being held. They have been separated from their families and subjected to cruel treatment for absolutely no reason. \n\n\nWE SAY NO MORE!\n\n\nJoin us in Miami on this terrible anniversary as we march to the headquarters of Southern Command, the center that operates Guantanamo Bay military base and detention center, and demand that fifteen years of torture and shame come to an end!'","9301 NW 33rd St, Doral, FL, 33172","https://www.google.com/maps?q=25.8049792,-80.3503638",Shut Down Trump's Torture Prison at Guantanamo!,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM),['https://facebook.com/events/394487687583928'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/shut-down-trump-s-torture-prison-at-guantanamo,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

We are advocates who believe that every child, regardless of race, sex, socioeconomic status and ability, deserve the opportunity to experience the transformative power of a well-rounded education.\n\n\nMISSION: To promote public education through peaceful demonstration and action.\n\n\nVISION\n\nPublic Schools will be safe, inclusive spaces for learning and critical thinking, where all children discover their passion(s) and role(s) as citizens. As members of March for Public Education, we aim to advance policy and recursively address issues of: equity, inclusion, accountability, a well-funded institution and the right to organize.\n\n\nOUR PRINCIPLES\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must fight for equity. All students should enter the classroom on equal footing. Special educators, social workers, school psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, occupational therapists, and countless others are critical to creating an equitable school culture. Striving toward this ideal is the only way to create a meritocratic environment that is fair for all students.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must strive to create a safe space for all. In this regard, schools have the recursive responsibility to combat racism, sexism, ableism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public education empowers children to discover their desires, passions and potential. In turn, children become tenacious adults who are critical thinkers, involved citizens and lifelong learners. The arts, humanities, mathematics, sciences and physical education are equally vital in developing the whole child.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must be held accountable in the fight for equity. Accountability can include thoughtful standards and purposeful testing. These structures should strive to help schools provide a better education to students and should coincide with intentional professional development for teachers.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A well-funded public education is a right of all children, regardless of their intersectional identities. For profit educational institutions and their fundamental motivation for capital are incongruous in helping children realize their full identity.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Faculty and staff have the right and responsibility to organize. As members of the institution that is public education, stakeholders must challenge societal paradigms on behalf of students and the community.""",", Salt Lake City, UT","https://www.google.com/maps?q=40.7607793,-111.8910474",March for Public Education Salt Lake City,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,"Salt Lake City, UT",['https://facebook.com/events/1261647977256958'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-public-education-salt-lake-city,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

It should take us about 15 minutes to walk to Market Square where we will hold a visibility until 3 PM.\n\n\nWhy do we march?\n\n\nResearch studies have shown that Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s genetically-modified foods can lead to serious health conditions such as the development of cancer tumors, infertility and birth defects. In the United States, the FDA, the agency tasked with ensuring food safety for the population, is steered by ex-Monsanto executives, and we feel that\xe2\x80\x99s a questionable conflict of interests and explains the lack of government-lead research on the long-term effects of GMO products. Recently, the U.S. Congress and president collectively passed the nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cMonsanto Protection Act\xe2\x80\x9d that, among other things, bans courts from halting the sale of Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s genetically-modified seeds.\n\n\nFor too long, Monsanto has been the benefactor of corporate subsidies and political favoritism. Organic and small farmers suffer losses while Monsanto continues to forge its monopoly over the world\xe2\x80\x99s food supply, including exclusive patenting rights over seeds and genetic makeup. Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s GMO seeds are harmful to the environment; for example, scientists have indicated they have caused colony collapse among the world\xe2\x80\x99s bee population.\n\n\nWhat are solutions we advocate for?\n\n\nVote with your dollar by buying organic and boycotting Monsanto owned companies that use GMOs in their products. Labeling of GMOs so that consumers can make those informed decisions easier. Repealing relevant provisions of the US\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMonsanto Protection Act.\xe2\x80\x9d Calling for further scientific research on the health effects of GMOs. Holding Monsanto executives and Monsanto-supporting politicians accountable through direct communication, grassroots journalism, social media, etc. Continuing to inform the public about Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. Taking to the streets to show the world and Monsanto that we won\xe2\x80\x99t take these injustices quietly. We will not stand for cronyism. We will not stand for poison.

"Jun 11, 2017 10:00 AM - Jun 11, 2017  2:00 PM EDT","b'Visit webpage and register to march in DC: http://www.equalitymarch2017.com\n(Washington, DC) \nThe Equality March for Unity and Pride named a diverse group of leaders with years of advocacy and community mobilization in LGBTQ+ liberation movements across the country and the world as 12 of its national co-chairs. The co-chairs will be responsible for guiding the ongoing development of the march, which will take place on June 11 in Washington, DC. \n""This is the most diverse national executive committee of any of the past five LGBTQ+ marches in Washington"" said San Diego City Commissioner and National Co-Chair Nicole Murray Ramirez, who has served on the national organizing committees of all five past Marches in Washington. ""From queer youth, Two-Spirit members, Transgender, Black Lives Matter activists, Undocumented, Immigrant, to HRC, AmFar, and various organizations. The Equality March and the rally stage will indeed truly represent the changing faces of the U.S. and of our LGBTQ+ movement.""\nInspired by the queer liberation movement\'s history of diverse, inclusive, and politically resonant public demonstrations, the Equality March for Unity and Pride will elevate and mobilize LGBTQ+ communities by highlighting those who, historically, have been actively silenced and neglected in the fight for full liberation, so that we may find unity and strength through diversity. The march is centered on the principle that in order to heal from the decades of neglect and erasure of marginalized people in the community, we must center transgender and gender expansive communities, and people of color. The co-chairs demand the inclusion of those left behind by social justice movements, including Black, Latinx, Bisexual, and differently-abled individuals. The co-chairs firmly believe that the community finds strength in diversity, and that the current political and social movement demands not just solidarity, but work towards intentional equity, representation, and protection of the most vulnerable. \nEquality March planners are working in coordination with the National Parks Service. Further details on the logistics of the march will be released in the coming weeks. \nSister marches are planned in more than 25 cities across the country for June 11 in solidarity with the March\'s mission to support the ongoing struggle for rights and safety for all LGBTQ+ individuals and families with similar emphasis on queer people of color,transgender, and gender nonconforming communities.\n""As a cis gay white male of privilege, I recognize that for far too long certain members of LGBTQ+ Communities have been underserved both here in the United States and abroad,"" said national co-chair David Bruinooge. ""They need to finally be given the same equity, equality, visibility, protection, access, liberties, justice, and inclusion as the most privileged among us in the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ liberation. This movement is an opportunity for LGBTQ+ communities to move forward together in solidarity and ensure together that all all our voices will not be silenced by those who want to roll back previous progress or impede necessary future change.""\n""Transgender people are at the front lines of every movement from immigration and reproductive justice to the fight for Black Lives Matter yet our realities and experiences need to be centered and our voices amplified,"" said Catalina Velasquez, Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships and Communications at Casa Ruby,President of Consult Catalina, and Board Vice-Chair of Our Revolution. She is the first undocumented transgender woman appointed Commissioner of the DC Mayor\'s Office of Latino Affairs, and a national co-chair of the March. ""Sexual and Gender liberation are key in our resistance to the current anti-immigrant and anti-transgender administration and the ongoing slaughter of transgender people of color. I am part of this march so the T in LGBTQ+ is not a footnote or a lost addendum in an everyday larger acronym. I march because there are 11.2 million undocumented immigrants of which hundreds of thousands are LGBTQ+ facing persecution, detention, and deportation to a death sentence, yet we see little to no public outcry. I march because pride is an act of resistance in a world where over 80 countries criminalize people based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity.""\nOur national Co-Chairs include: \n1.\nAnika Simpson, Ph.D.\n, Founder, Beyond Policy LLC | Associate Professor of Women\'s & Gender Studies and Philosophy at Morgan State University | Pronouns: She, Her, Hers\n2.\nAshley Smith\n, The Capital Pride Alliance | Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Board Member | Pronouns: He, Him, His\n3.\nCatalina Velasquez\n, Consult Catalina President | Casa Ruby Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships and Communications | Washington DC Mayor\'s Office of Latino Affairs Commissioner | Our Revolution Board Vice Chair | GetEqual Board Co-Chair | Megaphone Strategies Board Member | Inclusv Board Member | Trans United Fund Board Member | United We DREAM\'s Queer Undocumented Immigrant Project (QUIP) Advisory Council | Pronouns: She, Her, Hers, Trans Goddess.\n4.\nDavid Bruinooge\n, Founder: The Equality March for Unity & Pride | Pronouns: He, Him, His\n5.\nElle Hearns\n, Executive Director of The Marsha P Johnson Institute | Pronouns: She, Her, Hers\n6.\nJos\xc3\xa9 L.

Boulder Friend's Meeting, Showing Up for Racial Justice Boulder, Unitarian Universalist Church of Boulder, and Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center are co-hosting a presentation with Debby Irving, author of the award-winning book, Waking Up White, and Finding Myself in the Story of Race.\n\n\nDebby will use historical and media images to tell the story of how she unlearned her white-skewed belief system. This workshop is designed to support white people in making the paradigm shift from \xe2\x80\x98fixing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98helping\xe2\x80\x99 those believed to be \xe2\x80\x9cneedy,\xe2\x80\x9d to focusing on internalized sense of white superiority and its role in perpetuating racism at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and cultural levels. The two-hour program, which Debby frequently presents at the White Privilege Conference, includes time for reflection, dialog, and Q&A.\n\n\nDebby Irving is a racial justice educator and author.  A community organizer and classroom teacher for 25 years, Debby Irving grappled with racial injustice without understanding racism as a systemic issue or her own whiteness as an obstacle to it. \n\nAs general manager of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Dance Umbrella and First Night, and later as an elementary school teacher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she struggled to make sense of tensions in racially mixed settings she could feel but could not explain. In 2009, Debby took a graduate school course, Racial and Cultural Identities, which gave her the answers she\xe2\x80\x99d been looking for and helped launch her on a journey of discovery. Now, leading workshops and presentations around the country, Debby devotes herself to exploring the impact white skin can have on perception and how individuals can help themselves and others change misconceptions and attitudes. \n\n\nSuggested donation $15 (cash or check).

The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.\nThe President just fired the FBI Director, a highly concerning move that may be intended to thwart the ongoing FBI investigation into Russian interference and ties to Donald Trump and his associates. Congressional investigations in the House and Senate have been slow, under-resourced, and mired in partisan politics. Many Congressional leaders have called for an independent investigation, a special prosecutor or a commission to fairly investigate these concerns. Despite the clear will of the people, their calls have not been answered.\nTherefore, we call for a #MarchForTruth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that the people want answers.\nThe legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.\nAcross the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd.\nOur goals are simple:\n1.) A special prosecutor must be named, an independent commission established and Congressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests.\n2.) As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible.\n3.) Congress should require Donald Trump to release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity.\n4.) If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.\n________________\nFor more information, press inquiries, or to volunteer: \n[email\xc2\xa0protected]\n/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\nFor general information on the national marches: \n[email\xc2\xa0protected]\n/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\n*More event details will be released as soon as possible.""","Seattle, WA","https://www.google.com/maps?q=47.6062095,-122.3320708",March For Truth Seattle,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,,['https://facebook.com/events/1723249677690442'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-truth-seattle,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

NO! We REFUSE to Accept A Fascist America! We won\'t normalize\xe2\x80\xa6 accommodate\xe2\x80\xa6conciliate\xe2\x80\xa6or collaborate as the Trump/Pence regime struggles to fully consolidate fascism.\nWe\'re protesting outside of the hearing on Wednesday morning (May 17 at 9:00am) at the courthouse on 7th and Stewart, where NWIRP will ask a judge to issue a restraining order against the cease-and-desist order until the whole case can be heard in court. \nSpecifics of this case detailed at link below:\nhttps://www.nwirp.org/nwirp-challenges-order-from-department-of-justice-to-cease-and-desist-providing-legal-assistance-to-unrepresented-individuals-in-deportation-proceedings/\nMORE ON FASCIST JEFF SESSIONS:\nSessions needs to be called out for leading the fascist escalation of mass incarceration. Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a sweeping new policy instructing federal prosecutors to pursue the most severe possible charges and penalties for crimes. A person arrested possessing one joint, for example, would receive a mandatory sentence of one year in prison. These mandatory minimum sentences, especially pertaining to nonviolent drug crimes, have been shown in the past to disproportionately affect Black and Latino people. This racist policy will amplify and expand the slow genocide of mass incarceration.\nThe Washington Post rightfully called this approach ""cruel and ineffective."" Sessions--who has said he thought the KKK was ""OK"" until he found out some of them smoke marijuana--is an integral part of the Trump/Pence fascist regime. As head of the Justice Department, he will have the power to use the oppressive incarceration system to destroy MILLIONS more lives.\nIn this moment, we cannot be passive. The administration is moving very quickly to impose horrific and oppressive policies, and they have made clear that they will target those who do not fit their white supremacist vision. No more business as usual! We must be the ones to act, saying NO! to the entire regime, organizing for the time when millions of people can flood the streets and demand that this regime be driven from power.\nWho is Jeff Sessions:\nJeff Sessions led the prosecution of three Black civil rights workers for attempting to register Black people to vote in areas of Alabama where virtually no Black people had been able to vote, near the infamous town of Selma. He also called a white civil right lawyer a ""disgrace to his race"" for litigating voting rights cases.\nUnder Sessions leadership, Alabama used the torturous practice of hitching posts. This is where prisoners were shackled for as long as 7 hours in the broiling heat of Alabama\'s summer to chest-high horizontal bars. They were deprived of food, water and the toilet. This along with chain gangs (men tied together in groups of 5 with 8 feet of chain between them) and involved hard labor breaking walks. These torturous practices disproportionately affected Black people and were ruled un-constitutional.'","700 Stewart Street, Seattle, WA, 98101","https://www.google.com/maps?q=47.6151563,-122.3363965",Emergency Seattle Courthouse Protest: Sessions v.

His immediate executive orders have targeted Muslims, immigrants, women, Trans youth, and Black people severely. His appointments and early policies also reveal a total disdain for any of the hard fought gains won by people\'s movements from the last century, including environmental protections, Civil Rights, unions, public education, and social services. His belligerence has extended across the world with war threats on multiple countries, a grossly expanded military budget, and resumption of a nuclear arms race. \nBut the attacks on oppressed people at home are not limited to those carried out by racist ICE and cops. Since Trump\'s inauguration more than 90 bomb threats have been made on Jewish centers, dozens of mosques have been burned, over 400 reported hate crimes have taken place, including murders carried out by white supremacists. When confronted, the government\'s reply to this surge in racist violence has been little more than a shoulder shrug. \nThe Democrats have postured as though they are resisting this assault on people\'s rights but their record already tells a different story of continued bootlicking of Wall Street and the military. Nothing is more telling of this fact than their decision to maintain the status quo leadership by electing Tom Perez as DNC and refusing to ban corporate lobbying. The only ""resistance"" the Democrats have mounted is one based on the desire of the Pentagon and CIA to launch an all out war on Russia despite the fact it is the people of the U.S. and the people of Russia who will suffer while they and their children sit comfortably on Capitol Hill raking in money. \nA glimmer of hope has risen up though with innumerable protests taking place all over the country from the mass actions in defense of Native rights to marches for healthcare and political strikes by immigrants and women. It was the people who defeated the first Muslim ban when they boldly took over airports. Only this militant, independent action can stand up to Trump, the duopoly, and Wall Street. \nAnd while Wall Street and the pentagon have their representatives in the Democrats and Republicans, we too, the people, need our own leaders. Only a true people\'s party that fights for the people\'s rights can build and lead a resistance movement capable of defeating Trump and his worse policies. Only a true people\'s party can finally break the dictatorship that the billionaires and bankers hold over society and build a new world. \nJoin the Party for Socialism and Liberation for our Los Angeles Socialism Conference titled, ""Building  a People\'s Party"". We will have a  series of workshops and panels to discuss burning questions facing the people and movement in the era of Trump. We will engage in practical discussions about building a people\'s party and the fight for socialism. \nLimited parking on Westmoreland/8th.

"Jun 2, 2017 10:00 AM - Jun 4, 2017  6:00 PM EDT","b'A powerful resistance is taking shape in the U.S. Mass spontaneous protests fill the streets and the opposition to the Trump regime heralds an era of civil unrest the likes of which America has not seen for decades. The protesters\' immediate object is the new president and the singularly dangerous and reactionary regime he leads, but it has the potential to move beyond Trump to address the system that produced him. Most important of all, the budding resistance is thinking through questions of power, strategy, and tactics. We find ourselves faced with unprecedented dangers and disorienting shocks but also with massive opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 openings for building the movements for justice and liberation and pressing for fundamental transformations.\nThe dangers are easy to name \xe2\x80\x93 the ascendance of the highly organized, racist, misogynist right to an office in the White House; Republicans in lockstep, ready to fulfill their dream of the final dismantling of the public sector and the welfare state; an authoritarian American president looking to find like-minded thug cronies across the globe to make deals to vacuum out the last iotas of resources and profit from a planet in deep crisis. Sadly, Trump\'s most institutionally powerful opponents are those who desire a return to the glory days of cold war with Russia, not to mention the military manufacturers, contractors, and press operations for whom war and conflict remains the most profitable racket. Other opponents are the Democrats, useless even when they haven\'t just totally ignored a populist moment to ensure the nomination of probably their least popular, most militaristic, and big-money friendly candidate over a popular socialist who could, no doubt, have beaten Trump at his own game.\nIt goes without saying that none of these institutional forces favors labor, communal ownership, race freedom, or ecological healing. As rival powers tear themselves apart fighting over the last remaining wealth of a broken system, we must find our leverage and build our power in this new, unstable situation.\nThese past few years have seen the rise of major protest movements, and America\'s decades-long slide to the right has been arrested. The population is polarized, but more radical on both sides than we\'ve seen in a very long time. On our side, direct action, especially among the brave fighters at Standing Rock, garners wide support. A democratic socialist got very close to the White House. Young Americans favor socialism over capitalism. The Black Lives Matter movement has forged an interracial coalition against police brutality and state sanctioned race murder. And millions of formerly docile centrists and liberals are being radicalized by the regime\'s newly bold expression of power and profit politics \xe2\x80\x93 without even the ideological patina of the \xe2\x80\x9cfree market"" or \xe2\x80\x9cdemocracy"" to paper over anti-worker and militaristic policies at home and abroad. Perhaps most important, people are talking general strike.\nIn short, the old \xe2\x80\x9creasonable, responsible"" regime of exploitation has broken down. These are radical times. Which means they are times with great possibilities for real radicalism. Still, the left forces are inchoate, without mass mobilization organizations and searching for strategies that can build raw power and generate victories. Our task is to help organize, nurture, and shape the raw resistance that is exploding across America \xe2\x80\x93 and help to build what may come in its wake.\nWhat lessons have we learned from the last year or so? What is the status of the strategy of working within the Democratic Party rather than forming a new party organized to represent the interests of the working class? Where is rank and file \xe2\x80\x93 and especially international \xe2\x80\x93 labor organizing today? Do the social identities that structure the everyday life of workers impede class organization \xe2\x80\x93 or do they point the way to the most militant varieties of it? Where can we find the leverage for our movements when great powers battle? How do we engage in the kind of robust international labor organizing that we know is both the key to workers\' power and the antidote to the anti-immigrant right ascendant in so many places today? Most important, how will we build the three structures that we know we need \xe2\x80\x93 radical cultural interventions that craft a lefty common sense; a political party for working class people, and, most important, the economic ability to bring production and reproduction to a halt through mass coordinated strike action.\nThis is where Left Forum 2017 comes in. The strength of LF has always been its ecumenical inclusion of many perspectives, many groups, fighting on many fronts. Together, we will craft a united front moving in diverse but coordinated ways toward what we all know we need \xe2\x80\x93 international, multiracial, non-gendered working class power. As the largest gathering of the U.S. left, we come together this year to debate, to plan, to strategize, to build. We will engage the key questions \xe2\x80\x93 historical, analytical, theoretical, strategic \xe2\x80\x93 and forge the path ahead together. Our work has never been more important.\nTo this end, Left Forum will be organized from the start around the key substantive issues in shaping the resistance. We are calling for all panels to submit to particular panel tracks. Each track will have a number of panels and should end either with a concrete organizing session or with a more informal social gathering where people can strategize, enjoy each other\'s company, and craft explicit next steps. This year, it is more important than ever that when we gather as a thousands-strong, non-sectarian left convergence, the conference helps us move as a broad front to the next crucial steps. We expect to have a record number of panel submissions and the truth is, there are only so many available rooms. Panel track organizing will be decentered but discriminating, so BRING YOUR A GAME. The moment demands nothing less from all of us.\nWe have no choice but to organize now to fight the reactionary assault on hard-won rights and freedoms, from unionization to civil rights to abortion. We must move from symbolic protest to materially effective resistance. We need to identify pressure points in the system and push them. We must think seriously about crafting a new political party in the United States. But we must also simultaneously be working toward the broader set of changes \xe2\x80\x93 from a system based on alienation, abstraction, and exploitation to one based on human freedom and possibility \xe2\x80\x93 that animates all our struggles and that unites us as a left.'","524 W 59th St, New York, NY, 10019","https://www.google.com/maps?q=40.7707237,-73.9892342",Left Forum Conference 2017 - The Resistance,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,John Jay College of Criminal Justice,['https://facebook.com/events/1273563822706872'],risestronger.org,"['Energy and Climate', 'Governance and Rule of Law', 'Healthcare', 'Civil Rights and Civil Liberties', 'Education', 'Economy and Jobs']",['Conference'],https://risestronger.org/events/left-forum-conference-2017-the-resistance-59242597-6d42-486e-8986-a5845cf8b732,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

However while chemical agriculture pushes us towards climate crisis - small-scale, agro-ecologic farmers are standing up to remind us that healthy soil, diverse seeds and strong farming communities are in fact an essential solution to cool the planet and feed the world in a just and sustainable manner. As La Via Campesina points out, \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies for sustainable agriculture on a small-scale can not only reduce emissions from industrial agriculture, but can in fact contribute to carbon sequestration in the soil, and through the preservation of native forests and biodiversity.""\nIn countries around the world, women, who produce 60-80% of all food in developing nations, are rising to protect their soil, seeds, lands and livelihoods. In this training we will explore women leading movements for healthy soils and regenerative farming and the role of soils in climate solutions, while also understanding that farming land cannot become a carbon offset mechanism for managing the climate crisis. Presenters will discuss women farmers, agro-ecology, peasant farming, and carbon sequestration as part of the solution to the climate crisis, while highlighting farmers\' rights, food sovereignty and ecosystem integrity.\nSpeakers to date include: Precious Phiri (Regeneration Internationall, Zimbabwe); Diana Donlon (Center for Food Safety\'s Cool Foods Campaign, USA); Elizabeth Mpofu (General Coordinator of La Via Campesina, Zimbabwe); Calla Rose Ostrander (Project Drawdown, USA)\nFull details, speaker biographies and call in information will be available at: \nhttp://wecaninternational.org/pages/us-climate-ini...'",,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=34.1047122,-117.5788718","Women for Soils: Healthy Soils, Restorative Small-Scale Farming",Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,"FREE, ONLINE TRAINING",['https://facebook.com/events/373858063007189'],risestronger.org,[],['Public Talk'],https://risestronger.org/events/women-for-soils-healthy-soils-restorative-small-scale-farming,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

"Jul 2, 2017 11:00 AM - Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM PDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy.

One of the most dangerous places where the regimes of Trump and Netanyahu converge are in exchange programs that bring together police, ICE, border patrol, and FBI from the US with soldiers, police, border agents, etc. from Israel. In these programs, \xe2\x80\x9cworst practices"" are shared to promote and extend discriminatory and repressive policing in both countries (including extrajudicial executions, shoot-to-kill policies, police murders, racial profiling, massive spying and surveillance, deportation and detention, and attacks on human rights defenders).\nWe will present information on JVP and the Deadly Exchange national campaign, solicit feedback, and break into working groups to discuss how to expand the definition of sanctuary to include all people targeted by aggressive policing.

It exists solely to remind people that North Carolina is having a special election in 2017 for many legislative districts across the state.  \nWhy are we having a special election in 2017?  Because a federal court has ordered us to redraw many of our districts due to the unlawful use of race in the last round of redistricting (see \nhttp://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-governme...\n).  And new districts means new elections.\nHere\'s the big opportunity: If we can pick up a small handful of seats, we can break the GOP supermajority and sustain Gov. Cooper\'s vetoes.  Unlocking Gov. Cooper\'s veto would bring an abrupt halt to the far-right freight train that keeps pulling our state into the national news in ways that don\'t make us look good.\nThe key to winning those races is going to be getting out the vote, and this event is a simple tool to help do that.\nHere\'s all you need to do:\n1) Join our event.\n2) Share the event on your page (and re-share on your page whenever you think your friends need a reminder).\n3) ***Most Important*** - Invite your friends to join the event by clicking ""invite friends"" on the right-hand side of the event.

At the time the U.S. was founded, its female citizens did not share all of the same rights as men, including the right to vote. It was not until 1848 that the movement for women's rights launched on a national level with a convention in Seneca Falls, New York, organized by abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) and Lucretia Mott (1793-1880). Following the convention, the demand for the vote became a centerpiece of the women's rights movement. Stanton and Mott, along with Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) and other activists, formed organizations that raised public awareness and lobbied the government to grant voting rights to women. After a 70-year battle, these groups finally emerged victorious with the passage of the 19th Amendment.\nNOTE : If you are one of over 3,000 officially registered Indivisible Groups via \nindivisibleguide.com\n and are interested in organizing to host and promote the Indivisible Suffragette Sisters 19th Amendment Anniversary March as an Event in your area please contact the Board of Directors and message for more information on the ISS Facebook Page.\nLINK : \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/SUFFRAGETTESISTERSANDBROTHERS/about/?ref=page_internal\n \nFurther Description : TBA""",,,19th Amendment 100th Anniversary March,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,['https://facebook.com/events/206869993130547'],risestronger.org,['Civil Rights and Civil Liberties'],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/19th-amendment-100th-anniversary-march,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

We demand that Congress does its job and commences with impeachment proceedings immediately.\nGROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT\nPresident Trump must be impeached under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution for Treason, Bribery, or High Crimes and Misdemeanors, in particular:\n(1) Obstruction of Justice. Article 2, Section 1.8. of the Constitution Sets forth the oath of office: \xe2\x80\x9cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""\nIn his conduct of the Office of President of the United States, Trump in violation of his oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the Unites States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice in that he:\n1a.\tInterfered with the Department of Justice of the United States and Federal Bureau of Investigation by dismissing officers and investigators conducting investigations as to his illegal activities, including Preet Bharara the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Salley Yates, the Deputy and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n1b.\tMade false and misleading statements the people of the United States to deceive the people that investigations as to his misdeeds and those of his subordinates were and are being conducted thoroughly and completely with regard to his misconduct and the misconduct of his subordinate\n1c.\tFailed to provide information regarding General Flynn\'s dealings with the Russians to the House Intelligence Committee.\n(2) Violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause Article I, Section 9, Clause 8\n[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\nThe framers of the Constitution created this clause to ensure that US officials would not be corrupted by gifts or payments from foreign powers, yet President Trump receives a constant stream of cash and favors from foreign powers and their agents.\nInconsistent with the practice of all modern era Presidents and the expectations of the public, he has refused to place his business assets into a blind trust in which he would have no control over the assets and decision making of his businesses, but instead, directly and/or through his family continues to control his businesses and receive business revenues. The single largest tenant of Trump Tower is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a wholly state-owned company. The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority office holds a lease with Trump Tower. Foreign diplomats and foreign embassy events at Washington\'s Trump International Hotel. More than an obvious conflict of interest, receipt of any monies by him or his businesses under his control of him or his family from any foreign government or representative of a foreign government is a present or emolument in direct violation of the United States Constitution.\nTrump has financial relationships with businesses and governments throughout the world, including Turkey, the Philippines, India, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Viet Nam. Most importantly, he has financial dealings with Russia and China, the extent of which are largely unknown and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns as has been done by all modern era Presidents, a promise upon which he reneged.\nThese conflicts of interest have not only enriched Trump, buy have undermined our national security.\n(3)\tViolation of the Free speech rights of the citizens and the press.\nHas denied access to the White House by certain members of the press and publicly villified the press by calling them enemies of the people in violation of the First Amendment Rights of the people and his duty to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n(4)\tTreason. Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution defines treason in part as giving \xe2\x80\x9cAid and comfort"" to our enemies.\nBy condoning hacking by the Russian Government of a major political party and encouraging dissemination of hacked materials for purposes of political gain and by condoning unauthorized, unsecured meetings with Russia and other governments he has breached the security of the United States.\n(5) Libeled and slandered the former President of the United States with criminal intent. \nTrump maliciously and intentionally maligned President Obama by accusing the former President of wiretapping him. Making a false allegation of a crime is a crime.\n(6) Issuance of a travel ban in Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\n6a.\tThe order singles out persons because of their religious preference in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6b.\tBecause the order bans individuals from specific Muslim countries, it establishes a religious test in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n6c.\tThe travel ban gives the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited powers without procedural protections in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nDonald Trump\'s extreme disregard for the Constitution is a profound subversion of the Office of the President. Neither do we feel our country is in safe nor able hands, and we will not quietly ride out a tenure that threatens our democracy and way of life. We demand that Congress stop enabling President Trump through an embarrassing and potentially catastrophic charade of normalcy. The future of American Democracy rests in their hands. \nCONGRESS: DO YOUR JOB, OR LOSE YOUR JOB.\nIMPEACH DONALD TRUMP NOW.\nWHY WE MARCH FOR IMPEACHMENT\nDonald Trump has been in violation of the Constitution from the day he was sworn into the office of President.\nWe cannot abide a Congress that turns a blind eye to the constitutional breaches of our Commander in Chief. We demand that Congress does its job and commences with impeachment proceedings immediately.\nGROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT\nPresident Trump must be impeached under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution for Treason, Bribery, or High Crimes and Misdemeanors, in particular:\n(1) Obstruction of Justice. Article 2, Section 1.8. of the Constitution Sets forth the oath of office: \xe2\x80\x9cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""\nIn his conduct of the Office of President of the United States, Trump in violation of his oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the Unites States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice in that he:\n1a.\tInterfered with the Department of Justice of the United States and Federal Bureau of Investigation by dismissing officers and investigators conducting investigations as to his illegal activities, including Preet Bharara the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Salley Yates, the Deputy and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n1b.\tMade false and misleading statements the people of the United States to deceive the people that investigations as to his misdeeds and those of his subordinates were and are being conducted thoroughly and completely with regard to his misconduct and the misconduct of his subordinate\n1c.\tFailed to provide information regarding General Flynn\'s dealings with the Russians to the House Intelligence Committee.\n(2) Violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause Article I, Section 9, Clause 8\n[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\nThe framers of the Constitution created this clause to ensure that US officials would not be corrupted by gifts or payments from foreign powers, yet President Trump receives a constant stream of cash and favors from foreign powers and their agents.\nInconsistent with the practice of all modern era Presidents and the expectations of the public, he has refused to place his business assets into a blind trust in which he would have no control over the assets and decision making of his businesses, but instead, directly and/or through his family continues to control his businesses and receive business revenues. The single largest tenant of Trump Tower is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a wholly state-owned company. The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority office holds a lease with Trump Tower. Foreign diplomats and foreign embassy events at Washington\'s Trump International Hotel. More than an obvious conflict of interest, receipt of any monies by him or his businesses under his control of him or his family from any foreign government or representative of a foreign government is a present or emolument in direct violation of the United States Constitution.\nTrump has financial relationships with businesses and governments throughout the world, including Turkey, the Philippines, India, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Viet Nam. Most importantly, he has financial dealings with Russia and China, the extent of which are largely unknown and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns as has been done by all modern era Presidents, a promise upon which he reneged.\nThese conflicts of interest have not only enriched Trump, buy have undermined our national security.\n(3)\tViolation of the Free speech rights of the citizens and the press.\nHas denied access to the White House by certain members of the press and publicly villified the press by calling them enemies of the people in violation of the First Amendment Rights of the people and his duty to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n(4)\tTreason. Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution defines treason in part as giving \xe2\x80\x9cAid and comfort"" to our enemies.\nBy condoning hacking by the Russian Government of a major political party and encouraging dissemination of hacked materials for purposes of political gain and by condoning unauthorized, unsecured meetings with Russia and other governments he has breached the security of the United States.\n(5) Libeled and slandered the former President of the United States with criminal intent. \nTrump maliciously and intentionally maligned President Obama by accusing the former President of wiretapping him. Making a false allegation of a crime is a crime.\n(6) Issuance of a travel ban in Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\n6a.\tThe order singles out persons because of their religious preference in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6b.\tBecause the order bans individuals from specific Muslim countries, it establishes a religious test in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n6c.\tThe travel ban gives the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited powers without procedural protections in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nDonald Trump\'s extreme disregard for the Constitution is a profound subversion of the Office of the President. Neither do we feel our country is in safe nor able hands, and we will not quietly ride out a tenure that threatens our democracy and way of life. We demand that Congress stop enabling President Trump through an embarrassing and potentially catastrophic charade of normalcy. The future of American Democracy rests in their hands. \nCONGRESS: DO YOUR JOB, OR LOSE YOUR JOB.\nIMPEACH DONALD TRUMP NOW.'","Omaha, NE","https://www.google.com/maps?q=41.2523634,-95.9979883",Impeachment March Omaha,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,TBD,['https://facebook.com/events/301120893670853'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/impeachment-march-omaha,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

Patriotic attire to display our love of this country.  Speakers and march route still in the works.\nHere's why we're doing this:\nThere is more than sufficient cause for alarm about the role Russian state-led hacking and information warfare played in the 2016 election, and there are crucial unanswered questions about the relationship between the Russian state and Donald Trump, his associates and his campaign. The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.\nThere is an active FBI investigation into these matters, and revelations may emerge any moment. But Congressional investigations in the House and Senate have been slow, under-resourced, and mired in partisan politics. Many Congressional leaders have called for an independent investigation, a special prosecutor or a commission to fairly investigate these concerns. Despite the clear will of the people, their calls have not been answered.\nTherefore, we call for a #MarchForTruth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that Americans want answers. The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.\nAcross the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd. Our goals are simple:\n1. A special prosecutor must be named and Congressional investigations must be fully resourced.;\n2. As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;\n3. Donald Trump should release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;\n4. If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.\nJoin us!""","400 S Orange Ave, Orlando, FL 32801-3336","https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.5376214,-81.3796806",March For Truth,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Orlando City Hall,['https://facebook.com/events/1692237401084759'],risestronger.org,['Governance and Rule of Law'],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-truth-6b8204ab-89fd-4ece-b546-8dd8cc9bc2be,2017-05-17 04:06:01-07:00

Donovan, and Vermont Farm Bureau President Joe Tisbert.\nThe four panelists come to these issues with different perspectives and experience. Each will speak for a few minutes, followed by an open conversation with the audience.\nLouise Calderwood of Craftsbury, former Vermont Deputy Secretary of Agriculture (1998- 2006), now provides government relations and business development services to agricultural businesses and producers. Louise ran a dairy farm with her husband Randi and still runs their maple sugaring business;\nAbel Luna, of Burlington, Campaign and Education Coordinator for Migrant Justice, a Vermont organization working to build the voice, capacity, and power of the farmworker community to organize \nfor economic justice and human rights. Abel is a former farmworker, from a family of farmworkers;\nJon Lussier, of Hardwick, has spent over 40 years in the griculture business. He is manager of Northeast Kingdom Sales, a company specializing in farm auctions and the buying and selling of cattle;\nJohn Roberts, of Cornwall, Vermont, immigrated to Vermont from the United Kingdom in 1974, managed Shelburne Farms for three years, then ran his own dairy farm for 35 years. He currently works for the VT Agency of Agriculture as a small farm water quality specialist (and notes that he represents himself on this panel, not the agency).\nModerating this lively panel will be Riva Reynolds of Stannard, who researched the organic dairy industry in Vermont as a graduate student at UVM. While raising two children she manages online sales of her family\'s maple syrup farm business and writes her blog at woodandgrass.wordpress.com about food, farms, and family.\nThe Greater Hardwick Community Forum Committee is a group of citizens organizing events on topics of interest and relevance to Vermonters across the political spectrum.\nFor more information, contact: Paul Fixx, \n[email\xc2\xa0protected]\n/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(\'script\'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\'data-cfhash\'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(\'data-cfemail\')){for(e=\'\',r=\'0x\'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=\'%\'+(\'0\'+(\'0x\'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\n, (802) 441-4599'","126 Hazen Union Drive, Hardwick, VT","https://www.google.com/maps?q=44.5087558,-72.3651955","Who will milk the cows?
