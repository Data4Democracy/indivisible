"Jul 15, 2017 11:00 AM - Jul 15, 2017  3:00 PM EDT","b'To all healthcare workers, patients, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and allies:\nThe passage of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), was a devastating blow to our healthcare system. The AHCA, previously scored by the Congressional Budget Office, could result in as many as 24 million Americans losing coverage. It could roll back the ban on exclusion of pre-existing conditions and the essential health benefits requirements. It aims to create ""high-risk pools"" that would price our sickest patients out of coverage. We know the consequences of uncompensated care: More ER visits, less preventive care, worse health outcomes, and ultimately increased premiums on for all taxpayers. The AHCA is not the answer to reducing cost, and it will only result in loss of coverage.\nThe AHCA was passed without public hearings, without a CBO re-analysis, and without consultation of the medical community. It is opposed by the AMA, the AARP, and numerous national physician groups. Those who work with patients every day can agree that this bill is bad for patients.\nThis bill has been opposed by Democrats and Republicans alike. Effective healthcare reform must be achieved by bipartisan consensus. The manner in which the AHCA was rushed to a vote demonstrates a lack of concern for the profound ramifications on insurance market stability and patient coverage. This was political theater, not a true attempt at comprehensive reform. We cannot, as a community, allow our patients and loved ones to endure this amount of uncertainty with respect to their health.\nThe Rally For Health is a new coalition of concerned citizens looking to unify those opposed to the AHCA. Please join us for a NATIONAL RALLY FOR HEALTH: A DAY TO OPPOSE THE AHCA. We will be hosting a short rally in downtown D.C. but we encourage supporters in other states to host sister rallies on this day to stand in solidarity. Healthcare is a human right. Democrats and Republicans are patients first. Thank you for your support. Please RSVP if you can attend or if you plan to start a sister rally, please indicate details in the comments.\nMISSION STATEMENT\nThe mission of the Rally for Health:\n1. To oppose the American Healthcare Act (AHCA) and any other legislative measures that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) without improving coverage or cost.\n2. To support bipartisan initiatives that promote affordable universal healthcare coverage for all Americans.\n3. To lead a diverse coalition of healthcare professionals of all backgrounds and political philosophies to speak with one voice for our patients, our profession, and our nation.'",2017-06-05 20:29:42.933243,"Washington, DC, 02109","https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.902814,-77.0495174",NATIONAL RALLY FOR HEALTHCARE: OPPOSE THE AHCA,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,The Capitol,['https://facebook.com/events/241468252997142'],risestronger.org,['Healthcare'],[],https://risestronger.org/events/national-rally-for-healthcare-oppose-the-ahca

The subject matter is one that spans generations, and James Baldwin\'s outlook on it not to be missed.\nIn 1979, James Baldwin wrote a letter to his literary agent describing his next project, Remember This House. The book was to be a revolutionary, personal account of the lives and successive assassinations of three of his close friends-Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. At the time of Baldwin\'s death in 1987, he left behind only thirty completed pages of his manuscript.\nIn his 2016 documentary, Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck envisioned the book James Baldwin never finished. The result is a radical, up-to-the-minute examination of race in America, using Baldwin\'s original words and flood of rich archival material.\nI Am Not Your Negro is a journey into black history that connects the past of the Civil Rights movement to the present of #BlackLivesMatter. It is a film that questions black representation in Hollywood and beyond.

Supervisor John Cook of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors will present.\nDiversion First offers alternatives to incarceration for people with mental illness or developmental disabilities who come into contact with the criminal justice system for low level offenses. The goal of Diversion First is to intercede whenever possible to provide people with assessment, treatment or other needed supports. People needing diversion may also have a substance use disorder, which often co-occurs with mental illness.\nDiversion First was implemented because...\n*Too many people are in jail due to mental health issues. Jail is not the appropriate place to provide mental health treatment.\n*There is a need to prevent the incarceration of people with intellectual/developmental disabilities.\n*To intervene at the earliest point possible to de-escalate situations and avoid arrest.\n*It\'s the right thing to do to offer treatment to people who need it, *instead of jail being the default solution.\n*It\'s less costly for people to receive treatment instead of spending time in jail.\n*Treatment offers hope by helping people recover and take control of their lives.\n*1 in 5 Americans has a mental illness. Having a mental illness is not a crime.\nResponding to recommendations from the Ad Hoc Police Practices Review Commission, The Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution to support the national Stepping Up initiative to decriminalize mental illness.\nDiversion First participating agencies, including the police, sheriff and CSB, will providing resources for the event.

WEDDINGTON:\nIn 1964, Sarah Weddington entered the University of Texas Law School, where she was 1 of only 5 females entering the class of 120 students. Although she graduated in the top quarter of her class in 1967, no law firm would hire her. Instead, she joined a group of graduate students at the University of Texas-Austin that were researching ways to challenge various anti-abortion statutes. In the spring of 1970, Dr. Weddington and her counsel filed a suit against Henry Wade, the Dallas district attorney responsible for enforcing the anti-abortion statute. Dr. Weddington went on to appear in front of the Supreme Court in 1971 and again in 1972 to argue the right for women to have an abortion in the U.S. In January 1973, the Texas abortion law was overturned; legalizing abortion within the first trimester of a woman's pregnancy. After arguing Roe v. Wade, Dr. Weddington was elected to three terms in the Texas House of Representatives. Additionally, she served as General Counsel of the US Department of Agriculture in 1977, assistant to president Jimmy Carter 1978-1981, and was a lecturer at Texas Women's University 1981-1990. She is the founder of The Weddington Center, an organization that focuses on women to facilitate\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Development of leadership skills\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal resilience in meeting the draining demands of leadership.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Women's preparation for assuming leadership positions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Commitment to involvement in public and civic leadership\n..........\nABOUT SEATTLE NOW:  Seattle NOW's goal is to take action to bring about equality and justice for women.

However while chemical agriculture pushes us towards climate crisis - small-scale, agro-ecologic farmers are standing up to remind us that healthy soil, diverse seeds and strong farming communities are in fact an essential solution to cool the planet and feed the world in a just and sustainable manner. As La Via Campesina points out, \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies for sustainable agriculture on a small-scale can not only reduce emissions from industrial agriculture, but can in fact contribute to carbon sequestration in the soil, and through the preservation of native forests and biodiversity.""\nIn countries around the world, women, who produce 60-80% of all food in developing nations, are rising to protect their soil, seeds, lands and livelihoods. In this training we will explore women leading movements for healthy soils and regenerative farming and the role of soils in climate solutions, while also understanding that farming land cannot become a carbon offset mechanism for managing the climate crisis. Presenters will discuss women farmers, agro-ecology, peasant farming, and carbon sequestration as part of the solution to the climate crisis, while highlighting farmers\' rights, food sovereignty and ecosystem integrity.\nSpeakers to date include: Precious Phiri (Regeneration Internationall, Zimbabwe); Diana Donlon (Center for Food Safety\'s Cool Foods Campaign, USA); Elizabeth Mpofu (General Coordinator of La Via Campesina, Zimbabwe); Calla Rose Ostrander (Project Drawdown, USA)\nFull details, speaker biographies and call in information will be available at:\nhttp://wecaninternational.org/pages/us-climate-ini...'",2017-06-05 20:30:55.078248,,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=34.1047122,-117.5788718","WOMEN FOR SOILS: HEALTHY SOILS, RESTORATIVE SMALL-SCALE FARMING",Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,"FREE, ONLINE TRAINING",['https://facebook.com/events/373858063007189'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/women-for-soils-healthy-soils-restorative-small-scale-farming

That\'s probably why the theme of this year\'s conference is ""Turning the Tide."" That\'s not just a reference to what they think might be happening during Trump\'s reign. It is also the name of a\npopular antifa publication\nby Anti-Racist Action L.A. -\nPeople Against Racist Terror\n! That\'s a good sign that they are picking a fight, but this is the year where all realize that we do indeed need to come out and protect our freedoms like never before. Montgomery Bell Park Inn just might find itself with the biggest anti-AmRen rally they have seen since AmRen had been hosting conferences there in 2013.\nThe American Renaissance Conference - AmRen for short - is sponsored by the newsletter published by White Supremacist Jared Taylor, considered the godfather of the so-called \'alt-right"". It will be held at  Montgomery Bell State Park Inn, 45 minutes from Nashville, Tennessee and there is no public transportation there. They chose this location not just because it is a public facility - which means by the way that the public has a right to be inside the conference center that we should say has a great restaurant - but because it is so remote.

We demand that Congress does its job and commences with impeachment proceedings immediately.Donald Trump\'s extreme disregard for the Constitution is a profound subversion of the Office of the President. Neither do we feel our country is in safe nor able hands, and we will not quietly ride out a tenure that threatens our democracy and way of life. We demand that Congress stop enabling President Trump through an embarrassing and potentially catastrophic charade of normalcy. The future of American Democracy rests in their hands.\nOn Sunday, July 2nd, we march to demand Congress DO THEIR JOB and remove Trump from The White House.\nWHAT: IMPEACHMENT MARCH\nWHEN: SUNDAY JULY 2, 2017\n#ImpeachmentMarchSD #ImpeachmentMarch #Impeach45\n-------------------------------------------------\nGROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT\nPresident Trump must be impeached under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution for Treason, Bribery, or High Crimes and Misdemeanors, in particular:\n(1) Obstruction of Justice. Article 2, Section 1.8. of the Constitution Sets forth the oath of office: \xe2\x80\x9cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""\nIn his conduct of the Office of President of the United States, Trump in violation of his oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the Unites States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice in that he:\n1a.\tInterfered with the Department of Justice of the United States and Federal Bureau of Investigation by dismissing officers and investigators conducting investigations as to his illegal activities, including Preet Bharara the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Salley Yates, the Deputy and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n1b.\tMade false and misleading statements the people of the United States to deceive the people that investigations as to his misdeeds and those of his subordinates were and are being conducted thoroughly and completely with regard to his misconduct and the misconduct of his subordinate\n1c.\tFailed to provide information regarding General Flynn\'s dealings with the Russians to the House Intelligence Committee.\n(2) Violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause Article I, Section 9, Clause 8\n[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\nThe framers of the Constitution created this clause to ensure that US officials would not be corrupted by gifts or payments from foreign powers, yet President Trump receives a constant stream of cash and favors from foreign powers and their agents.\nInconsistent with the practice of all modern era Presidents and the expectations of the public, he has refused to place his business assets into a blind trust in which he would have no control over the assets and decision making of his businesses, but instead, directly and/or through his family continues to control his businesses and receive business revenues. The single largest tenant of Trump Tower is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a wholly state-owned company. The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority office holds a lease with Trump Tower. Foreign diplomats and foreign embassy events at Washington\'s Trump International Hotel. More than an obvious conflict of interest, receipt of any monies by him or his businesses under his control of him or his family from any foreign government or representative of a foreign government is a present or emolument in direct violation of the United States Constitution.\nTrump has financial relationships with businesses and governments throughout the world, including Turkey, the Philippines, India, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Viet Nam. Most importantly, he has financial dealings with Russia and China, the extent of which are largely unknown and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns as has been done by all modern era Presidents, a promise upon which he reneged.\nThese conflicts of interest have not only enriched Trump, buy have undermined our national security.\n(3)\tViolation of the Free speech rights of the citizens and the press.\nHas denied access to the White House by certain members of the press and publicly villified the press by calling them enemies of the people in violation of the First Amendment Rights of the people and his duty to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n(4)\tTreason. Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution defines treason in part as giving \xe2\x80\x9cAid and comfort"" to our enemies.\nBy condoning hacking by the Russian Government of a major political party and encouraging dissemination of hacked materials for purposes of political gain and by condoning unauthorized, unsecured meetings with Russia and other governments he has breached the security of the United States.\n(5) Libeled and slandered the former President of the United States with criminal intent.\nTrump maliciously and intentionally maligned President Obama by accusing the former President of wiretapping him. Making a false allegation of a crime is a crime.\n(6) Issuance of a travel ban in Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\n6a.\tThe order singles out persons because of their religious preference in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6b.\tBecause the order bans individuals from specific Muslim countries, it establishes a religious test in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n6c.\tThe travel ban gives the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited powers without procedural protections in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nPlease check back for more updates.'",2017-06-05 20:31:38.064200,"1600 Pacific Hwy, San Diego, CA, 92101","https://www.google.com/maps?q=32.7219487,-117.1721077",IMPEACHMENT MARCH - SAN DIEGO,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,San Diego County Administration Center,['https://facebook.com/events/1738462749497526'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/impeachment-march-san-diego-e13e2c89-e267-4698-a0fd-6072543c8862

Boulder Friend's Meeting, Showing Up for Racial Justice Boulder, Unitarian Universalist Church of Boulder, and Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center are co-hosting a presentation with Debby Irving, author of the award-winning book, Waking Up White, and Finding Myself in the Story of Race.\nDebby will use historical and media images to tell the story of how she unlearned her white-skewed belief system. This workshop is designed to support white people in making the paradigm shift from \xe2\x80\x98fixing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98helping\xe2\x80\x99 those believed to be \xe2\x80\x9cneedy,\xe2\x80\x9d to focusing on internalized sense of white superiority and its role in perpetuating racism at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and cultural levels. The two-hour program, which Debby frequently presents at the White Privilege Conference, includes time for reflection, dialog, and Q&A.\nDebby Irving is a racial justice educator and author.  A community organizer and classroom teacher for 25 years, Debby Irving grappled with racial injustice without understanding racism as a systemic issue or her own whiteness as an obstacle to it.\nAs general manager of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Dance Umbrella and First Night, and later as an elementary school teacher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she struggled to make sense of tensions in racially mixed settings she could feel but could not explain. In 2009, Debby took a graduate school course, Racial and Cultural Identities, which gave her the answers she\xe2\x80\x99d been looking for and helped launch her on a journey of discovery. Now, leading workshops and presentations around the country, Debby devotes herself to exploring the impact white skin can have on perception and how individuals can help themselves and others change misconceptions and attitudes.\nSuggested donation $15 (cash or check).

Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\nWHEN WE MARCH\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Granger\xe2\x80\x99s regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.\nLater attempts to explain this two and a half year delay in the receipt of this important news have yielded several versions that have been handed down through the years. Often told is the story of a messenger who was murdered on his way to Texas with the news of freedom. Another, is that the news was deliberately withheld by the enslavers to maintain the labor force on the plantations. And still another, is that federal troops actually waited for the slave owners to reap the benefits of one last cotton harvest before going to Texas to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation. All of which, or neither of these version could be true. Certainly, for some, President Lincoln's authority over the rebellious states was in question   For whatever the reasons, conditions in Texas remained status quo well beyond what was statutory.\nhttp://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm""",2017-06-05 20:32:27.441775,"275 N Jordan Ave, Bloomington, IN, 47405","https://www.google.com/maps?q=39.168184,-86.516669",JUNETEENTH MID-DAY HOUSE PARTY,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center,['https://facebook.com/events/234550053696742'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/juneteenth-mid-day-house-party

"Jul 2, 2017 11:00 AM - Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM PDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\nDonald Trump has been in violation of the Constitution from the day he was sworn into the office of President.\nWe cannot abide a Congress that turns a blind eye to the constitutional breaches of our Commander in Chief. We demand that Congress does its job and commences with impeachment proceedings immediately.Donald Trump\'s extreme disregard for the Constitution is a profound subversion of the Office of the President. Neither do we feel our country is in safe nor able hands, and we will not quietly ride out a tenure that threatens our democracy and way of life. We demand that Congress stop enabling President Trump through an embarrassing and potentially catastrophic charade of normalcy. The future of American Democracy rests in their hands.\nOn Sunday, July 2nd, we march to demand Congress DO THEIR JOB and remove Trump from The White House.\nWHAT: IMPEACHMENT MARCH\nWHEN: SUNDAY JULY 2, 2017\n#ImpeachmentMarchSD #ImpeachmentMarch #Impeach45\n-------------------------------------------------\nGROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT\nPresident Trump must be impeached under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution for Treason, Bribery, or High Crimes and Misdemeanors, in particular:\n(1) Obstruction of Justice. Article 2, Section 1.8. of the Constitution Sets forth the oath of office: \xe2\x80\x9cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""\nIn his conduct of the Office of President of the United States, Trump in violation of his oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the Unites States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice in that he:\n1a.\tInterfered with the Department of Justice of the United States and Federal Bureau of Investigation by dismissing officers and investigators conducting investigations as to his illegal activities, including Preet Bharara the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Salley Yates, the Deputy and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n1b.\tMade false and misleading statements the people of the United States to deceive the people that investigations as to his misdeeds and those of his subordinates were and are being conducted thoroughly and completely with regard to his misconduct and the misconduct of his subordinate\n1c.\tFailed to provide information regarding General Flynn\'s dealings with the Russians to the House Intelligence Committee.\n(2) Violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause Article I, Section 9, Clause 8\n[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\nThe framers of the Constitution created this clause to ensure that US officials would not be corrupted by gifts or payments from foreign powers, yet President Trump receives a constant stream of cash and favors from foreign powers and their agents.\nInconsistent with the practice of all modern era Presidents and the expectations of the public, he has refused to place his business assets into a blind trust in which he would have no control over the assets and decision making of his businesses, but instead, directly and/or through his family continues to control his businesses and receive business revenues. The single largest tenant of Trump Tower is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a wholly state-owned company. The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority office holds a lease with Trump Tower. Foreign diplomats and foreign embassy events at Washington\'s Trump International Hotel. More than an obvious conflict of interest, receipt of any monies by him or his businesses under his control of him or his family from any foreign government or representative of a foreign government is a present or emolument in direct violation of the United States Constitution.\nTrump has financial relationships with businesses and governments throughout the world, including Turkey, the Philippines, India, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Viet Nam. Most importantly, he has financial dealings with Russia and China, the extent of which are largely unknown and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns as has been done by all modern era Presidents, a promise upon which he reneged.\nThese conflicts of interest have not only enriched Trump, buy have undermined our national security.\n(3)\tViolation of the Free speech rights of the citizens and the press.\nHas denied access to the White House by certain members of the press and publicly villified the press by calling them enemies of the people in violation of the First Amendment Rights of the people and his duty to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n(4)\tTreason. Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution defines treason in part as giving \xe2\x80\x9cAid and comfort"" to our enemies.\nBy condoning hacking by the Russian Government of a major political party and encouraging dissemination of hacked materials for purposes of political gain and by condoning unauthorized, unsecured meetings with Russia and other governments he has breached the security of the United States.\n(5) Libeled and slandered the former President of the United States with criminal intent.\nTrump maliciously and intentionally maligned President Obama by accusing the former President of wiretapping him. Making a false allegation of a crime is a crime.\n(6) Issuance of a travel ban in Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\n6a.\tThe order singles out persons because of their religious preference in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6b.\tBecause the order bans individuals from specific Muslim countries, it establishes a religious test in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n6c.\tThe travel ban gives the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited powers without procedural protections in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nPlease check back for more updates.'",2017-06-05 20:34:07.692645,"1600 Pacific Hwy, San Diego, CA 92101","https://www.google.com/maps?q=32.7219487,-117.1721077",IMPEACHMENT MARCH - SAN DIEGO,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,San Diego County Administration Center,['https://facebook.com/events/1738462749497526'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/impeachment-march-san-diego-32fc3b78-5f8b-4726-a26f-6409e1a6761d

"Jun 13, 2017  6:00 AM - Jun 13, 2017  7:00 PM EDT","b'Here is what you need to know and do:\nConventional wisdom says voter turnout in primaries does not reliably predict voter turnout in the general elections. So don\'t bother voting in the primary if you\'re cool with either primary candidate. People used that thinking to predict an easy win for Clinton despite the high primary turnout for Trump (see e.g. https://goo.gl/OA7inw). But others warned that this statistical correlation was rough and had nuances. They warned of a Trump victory as a result (see https://goo.gl/sTT56X).\nEven if you like both Perriello & Northam, or you couldn\'t care less who wins, you should STILL vote in the Democratic primary. More powerfully than a phone call or an office visit, your vote in the primary sends a signal to Kaine, Warner, Comstock VA-10, Taylor VA-2, Wittman VA-1, and swing district delegates at the state level (https://goo.gl/e0MUYv) that anti-Trump voters are furious and now involved in getting out the vote. It puts everyone notice that, like the Tea Party, we at Indivisible intend to win elections.\nPlease go to https://goo.gl/JMbDt1 to get details on whether you qualify to vote absentee and how to do so. (Key deadline is Tuesday June 6). Then if you do, please track your action at https://indivisiblearlingtonva.com/ on PC/Android, https://goo.gl/sVYUje on iPhone in the HIGH IMPACT ACTIONS section.\nIf you do not qualify to vote absentee, please vote on Tuesday June 13th and click the ""Going"" button to indicate that you\'re going to vote on this day.

We are advocates who believe that every child, regardless of race, sex, socioeconomic status and ability, deserve the opportunity to experience the transformative power of a well-rounded education.\nMISSION: To promote public education through peaceful demonstration and action.\nVISION\nPublic Schools will be safe, inclusive spaces for learning and critical thinking, where all children discover their passion(s) and role(s) as citizens. As members of March for Public Education, we aim to advance policy and recursively address issues of: equity, inclusion, accountability, a well-funded institution and the right to organize.\nOUR PRINCIPLES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must fight for equity. All students should enter the classroom on equal footing. Special educators, social workers, school psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, occupational therapists, and countless others are critical to creating an equitable school culture. Striving toward this ideal is the only way to create a meritocratic environment that is fair for all students.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must strive to create a safe space for all. In this regard, schools have the recursive responsibility to combat racism, sexism, ableism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public education empowers children to discover their desires, passions and potential. In turn, children become tenacious adults who are critical thinkers, involved citizens and lifelong learners. The arts, humanities, mathematics, sciences, and physical education are equally vital in developing the whole child.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must be held accountable in the fight for equity. Accountability can include thoughtful standards and purposeful testing. These structures should strive to help schools provide a better education to students and should coincide with intentional professional development for teachers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A well-funded public education is a right of all children, regardless of their intersectional identities. For-profit educational institutions and their fundamental motivation for capital are incongruous in helping children realize their full identity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Faculty and staff have the right and responsibility to organize. As members of the institution that is public education, stakeholders must challenge societal paradigms on behalf of students and the community.""",2017-06-05 20:35:06.734699,"Salt Lake City, UT","https://www.google.com/maps?q=40.7607793,-111.8910474",MARCH FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION - SALT LAKE CITY,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,,['https://facebook.com/events/1261647977256958'],risestronger.org,['Education'],[],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-public-education-salt-lake-city

""Whether it\'s the foodies or academics, the urbanists or the social justice advocates, the parks and trails people or the immigration activists, when you mention Buford Highway to people, there\'s usually an almost visceral response based on people\'s personal backgrounds and professional interests. Buford Highway is like a Rorschach test. It\'s fascinating.""\nIn addition to advocating for the development of cultural programming and promoting the local business environment, We Love BuHi is collaborating with other social enterprises and nonprofit organizations, as well as building strategic partnerships with local businesses and governments to find innovative approaches to design, land-use and community events within the Buford Highway corridor.\nBy working to create better community connections physically and culturally, We Love BuHi is thoughtfully addressing the sustainable growth aspects of environmentalism. Buford Highway has been written up several times as being one of the \xe2\x80\x9cworst roads in the county"" \xe2\x80\x93 and Marian\'s work is helping reverse this reputation by advancing the design of a place that is culturally significant and important to Atlanta.  Specifically, her team \xe2\x80\x93 through Atlanta Regional Commission funding and collaboration \xe2\x80\x93 completed the Buford Highway Master Plan, part of the Liveable Centers Initiative. This study supplements existing plans in both Chamblee and Doraville, and will help develop a plan and process to revitalize Buford Highway, addressing connectivity, affordable housing and pedestrian safety.\n""I decided to devote my time to this because it allows me to reclaim and reconnect the unwanted, rejected, disparate, disconnected pieces of my own identity,"" says Marian, ""and because I feel that it is important that Buford Highway be recognized as an important part of Atlanta, a natural continuation of our exploration of and conversation about what it means to be an Atlantan, an American. It has always been the people of Buford Highway, specifically its immigrants and refugees and their descendants, people who could\'ve easily been my parents and relatives, that have spurred me to delve more deeply into how improving urban design and planning processes can directly benefit the people who have given a community its character.""\nGeneration Green\'s Longleaf Award recognizes emerging environmental leaders in the Metro Atlanta community.

It exists solely to remind people that North Carolina is having a special election in 2017 for many legislative districts across the state.\nWhy are we having a special election in 2017?  Because a federal court has ordered us to redraw many of our districts due to the unlawful use of race in the last round of redistricting (see\nhttp://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-governme...\n).  And new districts means new elections.\nHere\'s the big opportunity: If we can pick up a small handful of seats, we can break the GOP supermajority and sustain Gov. Cooper\'s vetoes.  Unlocking Gov. Cooper\'s veto would bring an abrupt halt to the far-right freight train that keeps pulling our state into the national news in ways that don\'t make us look good.\nThe key to winning those races is going to be getting out the vote, and this event is a simple tool to help do that.\nHere\'s all you need to do:\n1) Join our event.\n2) Share the event on your page (and re-share on your page whenever you think your friends need a reminder).\n3) ***Most Important*** - Invite your friends to join the event by clicking ""invite friends"" on the right-hand side of the event.  You can invite up to 500 friends.  Even if they don\'t join, they\'ll see the name of the event and that will tell them there\'s an election in 2017.\nThat\'s it!

We've watched in horror as Trump has unilaterally & autocratically used executive orders to bar Muslim immigrants from seven Muslim majority nations; restart construction of #DAPL & #KeystoneXL; Roll back Dodd-Frank regulations, fast-track construction of his #BorderWall on the taxpayer's dime; reinstate the Global Gag Rule regarding abortion & reproductive rights; filled his cabinet with billionaires, multi-millionaires & corporate CEO's & Goldman Sachs executives & signed off on a botched Navy Seals raid that cost one soldier & many civilians, mainly woman & children as well as Nawar al-Awlaki, an eight year old who's father was killed in a drone strike by American forces.\nWe, the people of the United States of America will not tolerate the racist, sexist & xenophobic policies of the Trump administration; Trump won the election in spite of losing the Popular Vote by over 3 million votes, therefore, he does have a mandate from the masses; Russian manipulation of our electoral process only compounds that fact. We call on the people of the United States to rise up in solidarity with those who stand to lose the most under the Trump administration & take to the streets to #MarchAgainstTrump in order to call for his Impeachment from the Presidency of the United States of America. Stand up, Stand tall, Stand Proud & Fight Trump & the #Fascist thugs who support him & his administration.\nTentative Date & Time: July 08, 2017 @ 1:00PM.\nAll suggestions are welcome, & all activists & causes are welcome. We encourage all brave activists & organizers to start an FB Event page for each city & organize within their communities.

Based on disappointing DC pride events in recent years, it's likely that the National LGBT March will become a whitewashed corporate event that marginalizes LGBTQ people of color, undocumented LGBTQ folks, lower income LGBTQ folks, trans folks and women. The LGBTQ community deserves better.\nI've already tried reaching out to the coordinating committee and my questions about people of color and trans folks having leadership positions were deflected and rejected.\nThis is an alternative. I am not appointing myself to be in charge in any capacity. This event will be for the people, by the people, and led by the most marginalized. Please reach out to me if you are interested in coordinating, building infrastructure etc. In this political climate, we don't have time for the same old corporate pride events.  I'll be contacting local organizations in the coming days. Consider this a placeholder for folks who are interested in a mass demonstration of queer resistance that refuses to be whitewashed or coopted.\n**Note: this is just an idea. The form that this resistance will take depends wholly on the ideas, strategies, goals and needs of DC's most marginalized folks. Stay tuned for updates.

"Jul 2, 2017 12:30 PM - Jul 2, 2017  2:30 PM EDT","b'On Sunday, July 2nd, we march to demand Congress DO THEIR JOB and remove the President from The White House.\nThink of it as one enormous Town Hall Meeting.\nAccording to Robert Reich:\nBy my count, there are now four grounds to impeach Donald Trump. The fifth appears to be on its way.\nFirst, in taking the oath of office, a president promises to \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully execute the laws & the constitution."" That\'s Article II Section 2.\nBut Trump is unfaithfully executing his duties as president by accusing his predecessor, president Obama, of undertaking an illegal and impeachable act, with absolutely no evidence to support the accusation.\nSecond, Article I Section 9 of the Constitution forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments. But Trump is making big money off his Trump International Hotel by steering foreign diplomatic delegations to it, and will make a bundle off China\'s recent decision to grant his trademark applications for the Trump brand \xe2\x80\x93 decisions Chinese authorities arrived at directly because of decisions Trump has made as president.\nThird: The 1st Amendment to the Constitution bars any law \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" But Trump\'s ban on travel into the United States from 6 muslim countries \xe2\x80\x93 which he initiated, advocated for, and oversees \xe2\x80\x93 violates that provision.\nFourth: The 1st Amendment also bars \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of the press.""

"Jul 22, 2017  9:00 AM - Jul 22, 2017  4:00 PM EDT","b'MISSION\nMarch for Public Education: To promote public education through peaceful demonstration and action.\nVISION\nPublic Schools will be safe, inclusive spaces for learning and critical thinking, where all children discover their passion(s) and role(s) as citizens. As members of March for Public Education, we aim to advance policy and recursively address issues of: equity, inclusion, accountability, a well-funded institution and the right to organize.\nOUR PRINCIPLES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must fight for equity. All students should enter the classroom on equal footing. Special educators, social workers, school psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, occupational therapists, and countless others are critical to creating an equitable school culture. Striving toward this ideal is the only way to create a meritocratic environment that is fair for all students.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must strive to create a safe space for all. In this regard, schools have the recursive responsibility to combat racism, sexism, ableism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public education empowers children to discover their desires, passions and potential. In turn, children become tenacious adults who are critical thinkers, involved citizens and lifelong learners. The arts, humanities, mathematics, sciences and physical education are equally vital in developing the whole child.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must be held accountable in the fight for equity. Accountability can include thoughtful standards and purposeful testing. These structures should strive to help schools provide a better education to students and should coincide with intentional professional development for teachers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A well-funded public education is a right of all children, regardless of their intersectional identities. For profit educational institutions and their fundamental motivation for capital are incongruous in helping children realize their full identity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Faculty and staff have the right and responsibility to organize. As members of the institution that is public education, stakeholders must challenge societal paradigms on behalf of students and the community.'",2017-06-05 20:38:06.992050,"Washington, D.C., DC","https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.9071923,-77.0368707",MARCH FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Washington,['https://facebook.com/events/254445494966564'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-public-education-tentative-date

This workshop is designed to support white people in making the paradigm shift from \'fixing\' and \'helping\' those believed to be \xe2\x80\x9cneedy,"" to focusing on internalized sense of white superiority and its role in perpetuating racism at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and cultural levels. The two-hour program, which Debby frequently presents at the White Privilege Conference, includes time for reflection, dialog, and Q&A.\nDebby Irving is a racial justice educator and author. A community organizer and classroom teacher for 25 years, Debby Irving grappled with racial injustice without understanding racism as a systemic issue or her own whiteness as an obstacle to it.\n2nd Portion of Event:\nReflection and Conversation Toward Positive Transformation\nRev. Dawn Riley Duval will 1) provide an overview of the current Black liberation movement, 2) facilitate a small group exercise, 3) invite the group to perceive racial justice as life-changing work rather than racial justice as a call to develop a habit of doing niceties for people of color.\nReverend Dr. Dawn Riley Duval is a social justice truth teller, a community organizer, a religious first responder, and is best known for her prophetic voice and community building as a leader in the Black Lives Matter Movement. As a Black, womanist, spiritually eclectic theologian, Rev. Dr. Duval is an ordained Itinerant Elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church who honors and practices African indigenous religions and rituals. She has experience as a community organizer, facilitator, and consultant to grassroots groups in Colorado, Namibia, and Tennessee.\nSuggested donation $15 (cash or check) but no one will be turned away.

We believe the normalization of hatred is not only unacceptable, but dangerous. We believe that North Carolina should pride itself on being welcoming and accepting of diverse groups of people, especially people who are of minority groups. This includes people of minority faith groups. On June 10th, a hate group called ACT 4 America is holding multiple anti-Sharia* rallies across the nation and at our state capital. They are trying to garner public support for President Trump's Muslim Ban which has been blocked in court. We believe that leaders need to denounce this hateful and divisive plan. Though these groups have a constitutional right to speak, we have a moral obligation to speak louder -\nNO HATE IN OUR STATE!\nPlease sign this petition to demand that Governor Roy Cooper issue a public statement denouncing this hateful and malicious targeting of our fellow North Carolinians.

Hence the ramifications,  such as mass enslavement, racial profiling, discriminatory legal applications of sentencing,  police killings, truth in sentencing laws (85%), life without parole, political prisoners long term confinements, private prisons ownerships, and no requirements of u.s prisons to offer rehabilitation programs. In summation, this is what we call the  Prison Industrial Enslavement Complex.

So far, marches are planned for Miami, West Palm Beach (Mar-a-Lago), Fort Myers/Naples, Boston & Wichita, with several others under way. Contact us to plan one in your city.\nSIGNIFICANCE OF DATE:\nFlag Day commemorates the adoption of the American flag \xe2\x80\x93 a work of art hand sewn by a woman and a symbol of vigilance, perseverance, freedom and justice. June 14 also happens to be the Electoral College President\'s birthday. What better way to celebrate that day, than with the \xe2\x80\x9cgift"" of protest art!\nOFFICIAL PARTNERS:\nActivistArtistA Gallery\nFancy Nasty Studios\nGood Eye Press\nThe Artful Activist\nThe Wynwood Yard\nBACKGROUND:\nThe current political climate has awoken an irrepressible need for artists/makers to take action. It has been encouraging to see the multitude of creative people around the globe making their voices heard.\nHistorically artists have led the way for social change. We have the tools to inspire others and create the visuals of propaganda. The creative community is vast, diverse and intersectional by nature, representing every background, gender, religious belief, sexual orientation, ethnicity, economic status and age. There are so many things we can use art to fight for \xe2\x80\x93 including health care, immigration, minority rights, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, net neutrality, democracy, peace and environmental protection. We can also use art to fight for the arts, as NEA funding was recently threatened. Let\'s unify all of the causes into a single march!\nThe specificity of protests for individual causes has been powerful and effective but it\'s time for a global show of solidarity. With art, we will express the world\'s unity against the growing trends of nationalism, intolerance, division and authoritarianism.\nWhile many individual artists, galleries and institutions are addressing these issues within the walls of the art world, we believe it\'s time to take it out to the streets. If we stand together, who knows what our creativity can accomplish!\nWHO WILL BE INVOLVED:\nPainters, sculptors, photographers, street artists, designers, digital artists, curators, collectors, galleries, critics, museums, colleges, writers, poets, playwrights, musicians, dancers, performers, singers, composers, historians, filmmakers and more. While artists will lead the way, the Artist March will be all-inclusive event.\nHOW YOU CAN HELP:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 INVITE friends to this event & SHARE on your page\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If you or someone you know would like to organize an Artist March in another city, be an official partner, or help with Miami\'s march, please email\n[email\xc2\xa0protected]\n/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(\'script\'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\'data-cfhash\'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(\'data-cfemail\')){for(e=\'\',r=\'0x\'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=\'%\'+(\'0\'+(\'0x\'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use #ARTISTMARCH when sharing photos of your city\'s event, or leading up the the event.

The run will start at the Chaco Canyon Visitors Center and end at the Bureau of Land Management offices in Farmington, NM.\nThe Greater Chaco Region is a checkerboarded area of Tribal, state, federal, and allotment land. The Bureau of Land Management has approved more than 400 new fracking wells without adequate Tribal consultation or protections for community health, water and climate impacts. Fracking development threatens ancient Chaco culture and sacred sites and also Navajo people and living communities in the area who have been dealing with the impacts of resource extraction for decades.\nPlease help native youth protect our health, our future and our Mother Earth.\nWe will run throughout the day and set up tents in the evenings at a predesignated camping area. We will host ""Southwest culture nights"" during our camping hours which will consist of songs, stories, prayers and ceremonies shared by Southwest elders from the area. These culture nights will be open to the public with dinner provided for those who attend.\nPARTICIPANTS ARE REQUIRED TO BRING CAMPING GEAR (TENTS, SLEEPING BAGS, ETC.,) FOR CAMPING NIGHTS.\nTHIS IS AN 80 MILE RUN SO PLEASE DRESS APPROPRIATELY FOR IT!

"Jul 2, 2017 11:00 AM - Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM PDT","b'On Sunday, July 2nd, we march to demand Congress DO THEIR JOB and remove Trump from The White House.\nAccording to Robert Reich:\nBy my count, there are now four grounds to impeach Donald Trump. The fifth appears to be on its way.\nFirst, in taking the oath of office, a president promises to \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully execute the laws & the constitution."" That\'s Article II Section 2.\nBut Trump is unfaithfully executing his duties as president by accusing his predecessor, president Obama, of undertaking an illegal and impeachable act, with absolutely no evidence to support the accusation.\nSecond, Article I Section 9 of the Constitution forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments. But Trump is making big money off his Trump International Hotel by steering foreign diplomatic delegations to it, and will make a bundle off China\'s recent decision to grant his trademark applications for the Trump brand \xe2\x80\x93 decisions Chinese authorities arrived at directly because of decisions Trump has made as president.\nThird: The 1st Amendment to the Constitution bars any law \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" But Trump\'s ban on travel into the United States from 6 muslim countries \xe2\x80\x93 which he initiated, advocated for, and oversees \xe2\x80\x93 violates that provision.\nFourth: The 1st Amendment also bars \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of the press."" But Trump\'s labeling the press \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemy of the people,"" and choosing who he invites to news conferences based on whether they\'ve given him favorable coverage, violates this provision.\nA fifth possible ground if the evidence is there: Article II Section 3 of the Constitution defines \xe2\x80\x9ctreason against the United States"" as \xe2\x80\x9cadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.""\nEvidence is mounting that Trump and his aides colluded with Russian operatives to win the 2016 presidential election.\nPresidents can be impeached for what the Constitution calls \xe2\x80\x9chigh crimes and misdemeanors."" The question is no longer whether there are grounds to impeach Trump. The practical question is whether there\'s the political will.\nThere are now at least four grounds on which to impeach Donald Trump. On Sunday, July 2nd, we march to tell Congress to do their job and remove the President from The White House.\nPlease check back for more updates.\n#ImpeachTrump #ImpeachmentMarchSD'",2017-06-05 20:41:04.271784,"128 Baycrest Ct, Newport Beach, CA 92660","https://www.google.com/maps?q=33.6563845,-117.8690634",IMPEACHMENT MARCH- ORANGE COUNTY,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Orange County California,['https://facebook.com/events/419984045039077'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/impeachment-march-orange-county-e4f19a74-e9e6-4d84-8cdb-d65d5f2bcc02

We are coming together in solidarity with our Muslim neighbors. We will say loud and clear that hate and Islamophobia are not welcome here. We will be peaceful and we will be resolute.

Build positive messages, we\'re here to uplift, support, and work towards lasting unity.\nAvoid \xe2\x80\x9cNot all Muslim"" type arguments- people deserve respect solely on the basis of their personhood. We don\'t want to contribute to the idea that marginalized folks need to prove themselves first.\nRemember \xe2\x80\x93 these are our neighbors, friends, community members so give them the respect and space that\'s due and also keep this in mind with your message.\n*Due to concerns over recent acts of harassment and violence by right wing extremists we have chosen to set the guest list feature for this event to private. When you respoond as ""going"" or ""interested"" your name will not appear publicly on this page.\nWe offer the following suggestions for making signs:\nTo emphasize the diversity and solidarity of the many communities who are coming together for this event, we suggests signs which read, ""I AM (3 things about yourself). I STAND WITH ISLAM.""\nBackground\nPlease use a white background: this can be thin plywood painted white, or cardboard-reinforced white posterboard.\nSize\nA very common size for posterboard available at most office supply stores and popular retailers such as Fred Meyer, Target and Walmart is 28"" x 22"".  Therefore, we will prescribe signs in two standardized sizes: 28 x 22 and 22 x 14.\nFor 28 x 22, please use 4-inch letter stencils, and for 22 x 14,  please use 3-inch letter stencils;  both of which are popular sizes and can be purchased or easily downloaded and printed.\nOrientation\nHorizontal\nFont\nPlease use capital block letters in fonts which are not overly-ornamental, and are easily readable. Please do not use the US military\'s common font. (Example attached.) Letters with softer or rounded edges/corners are preferred so long as they are easily read.\nSpacing\nFor both sign sizes, there is room for 3/4-inch margins top and bottom with 1/2-inch spaces in between each of the six lines of text.\nFormat\n(Example attached)\nLine 1 (centered) I AM A...\nLine 2 (justified left) [NOUN]\nLine 3 (justified left) [NOUN]\nLine 4 (justified left) [NOUN]\nLine 5 (centered) I STAND\nLine 6 (centered) WITH ISLAM\nColors\nAll letters on the same line should be one color (so that all letters are clearly defined and easy to read), but each line can be a different color, alternating or all the same. Colors should be dark to contrast with the white background.\nConstruction\n(Suggested): Die-cut or hand-cut letters glued in place is more ""assembly-line-friendly"" and will result in greater efficiencies compared to tracing and then coloring in letters.'",2017-06-05 20:41:22.455894,"4th Ave, Seattle, WA, 98101","https://www.google.com/maps?q=47.6099519,-122.3364498",SEATTLE STANDS WITH OUR MUSLIM NEIGHBORS,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Westlake Park,['https://facebook.com/events/401415030252081'],risestronger.org,"['Immigration', 'Civil Rights and Civil Liberties']",[],https://risestronger.org/events/seattle-stands-with-our-muslim-neighbors

The Constitution was written by our forefathers to ensure that WE THE PEOPLE have rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\nThe Declaration of Independence showcases the reasons that America was born.  It states:\n""When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature\'s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \xe2\x80\x94 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \xe2\x80\x94 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.""\nBut lately, WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES have felt that our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are somewhat shaky.  We go to work everyday, come home and watch the news, discuss what we see and what we feel is important, and then contact our government representatives who often ignore our letters, calls and even face to face meetings.  They are supposed to represent us, but do they know that? It seems that they are only listening to people like the Koch Brothers and others with plenty of money to spread around.\nUnited Voice of the Eagle is a celebration of ""WE THE PEOPLE"".  It is us, reminding our government that WE THE PEOPLE are in charge.  WE THE PEOPLE want representation in Congress, in the White House, and in all the State Houses as well.  We gather to declare what WE THE PEOPLE want in hopes that our representatives will hear us at last and realize that they are shortchanging the very people they are supposed to represent.\nSimply stated, WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA wish to be heard and listened to.

"Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\nWHEN WE MARCH\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists.

"Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy.

We demand that Congress does its job and commences with impeachment proceedings immediately.\nGROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT\nPresident Trump must be impeached under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution for Treason, Bribery, or High Crimes and Misdemeanors, in particular:\n(1) Obstruction of Justice. Article 2, Section 1.8. of the Constitution Sets forth the oath of office:  \xe2\x80\x9cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""\nIn his conduct of the Office of President of the United States, Trump in violation of his oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the Unites States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice in that he:\n1a.\tInterfered with the Department of Justice of the United States and Federal Bureau of Investigation by dismissing officers and investigators conducting investigations as to his illegal activities, including Preet Bharara the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Salley Yates, the Deputy and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n1b.\tMade false and misleading statements the people of the United States to deceive the people that investigations as to his misdeeds and those of his subordinates were and are being conducted thoroughly and completely with regard to his misconduct and the misconduct of his subordinate\n1c.\tFailed to provide information regarding General Flynn\'s dealings with the Russians to the House Intelligence Committee.\n(2) Violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause Article I, Section 9, Clause 8\n[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\nThe framers of the Constitution created this clause to ensure that US officials would not be corrupted by gifts or payments from foreign powers, yet President Trump receives a constant stream of cash and favors from foreign powers and their agents.\nInconsistent with the practice of all modern era Presidents and the expectations of the public, he has refused to place his business assets into a blind trust in which he would have no control over the assets and decision making of his businesses, but instead, directly and/or through his family continues to control his businesses and receive business revenues. The single largest tenant of Trump Tower is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a wholly state-owned company. The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority office holds a lease with Trump Tower. Foreign diplomats and foreign embassy events at Washington\'s Trump International Hotel. More than an obvious conflict of interest, receipt of any monies by him or his businesses under his control of him or his family from any foreign government or representative of a foreign government is a present or emolument in direct violation of the United States Constitution.\nTrump has financial relationships with businesses and governments throughout the world, including Turkey, the Philippines, India, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Viet Nam.  Most importantly, he has financial dealings with Russia and China, the extent of which are largely unknown and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns as has been done by all modern era Presidents, a promise upon which he reneged.\nThese conflicts of interest have not only enriched Trump, buy have undermined our national security.\n(3)\tViolation of the Free speech rights of the citizens and the press.\nHas denied access to the White House by certain members of the press and publicly villified the press by calling them enemies of the people in violation of the First Amendment Rights of the people and his duty to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n(4)\tTreason.  Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution defines treason in part as giving \xe2\x80\x9cAid and comfort"" to our enemies.\nBy condoning hacking by the Russian Government of a major political party and encouraging dissemination of hacked materials for purposes of political gain and by condoning unauthorized, unsecured meetings with Russia and other governments he has breached the security of the United States.\n(5) Libeled and slandered the former President of the United States with criminal intent.\nTrump maliciously and intentionally maligned President Obama by accusing the former President of wiretapping him. Making a false allegation of a crime is a crime.\n(6) Issuance of a travel ban in Violation of the Equal Protection  Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\n6a.\t The order singles out persons because of their religious preference in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6b.\t Because the order bans individuals from specific Muslim countries, it establishes a religious test in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n6c.\tThe travel ban gives the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited powers without procedural protections in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nDonald Trump\'s extreme disregard for the Constitution is a profound subversion of the Office of the President. Neither do we feel our country is in safe nor able hands, and we will not quietly ride out a tenure that threatens our democracy and way of life. We demand that Congress stop enabling President Trump through an embarrassing and potentially catastrophic charade of normalcy.

"Jul 2, 2017 11:00 AM - Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM PDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\nWHEN WE MARCH\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

We've Done our Share: Time to Clean Up Savannah River Site Not Dump More Waste on Us!\nSpecial interests are lurking that would like to profit off bringing highly radioactive commercial waste to the Savannah River Site for indefinite storage.  This dangerous waste - commercial spent nuclear fuel from US nuclear power plants and a special form of spent fuel from Germany - could be brought to the DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken.  But public opposition could derail these dangerous plans to turn SRS into an international waste dump.\nThe SRS Citizens Advisory Board, (a formal panel that advises DOE on clean-up of SRS) has before it this summer two draft recommendations against the waste import.  These recommendations will be raised and likely voted on at the CAB's Nuclear Materials Committee on the evening of June 6 in Aiken. We need a strong showing by the public at the meeting to oppose the waste import and to support the recommendations.\n______________\nSee the draft recommendations linked here:\nRecommendation against interim or long-term storage of commercial spent fuel:  https://tinyurl.com/lxl5wpn\nRecommendation against import of German spent fuel (via Charleston): https://tinyurl.com/mjm9x5z\n______________\nLet the SRS Citizens Advisory Board know that South Carolina doesn't want to be dumped on with highly radioactive waste from other states or from abroad.  Speak up in favor of two recommendations on this matter.\nWhen:  Tuesday, June 6, SRS CAB's Nuclear Materials Committee meeting, 6:30 - 8:20 p.m.  The recommendations are likely to be discussed at the full CAB meeting on July 24-25 in Aiken so we will also need to be there to speak in favor of the recommendations.\nWhere: About 5 miles south of downtown Aiken -\nDOE Meeting Center\n230 Village Green Blvd.\nSuite 220\nAiken, SC 29803\nSee SRS CAB website for more details and schedule:  http://www.srs.gov/general/outreach/srs-cab/srs-cab.html\nFor information and more background on nuclear waste and other issues related to SRS, visits SRS Watch  at http://www.srswatch.org""",2017-06-05 20:44:46.380945,,,"SAY ""NO!""

Salote is a native of Fiji, an island in the South Pacific that is experiencing forced displacement of coastal and rural communities as a result of rising seas, natural disasters and increased temperatures. Her program focuses on lifting the voices of communities that are most at risk to this issue by providing them with resources and tools to empower and protect communities and to defend their inalienable human rights and human dignities. UUSC\'s program targets to serve indigenous communities in the South Pacific and in Alaska.  Salote emphasizes the urgency of this crisis, \xe2\x80\x9cThese are indigenous communities and what they are experiencing is directly impinging on their basic human rights and their values as indigenous people. Governments must urgently respond to this crisis to protect the rights and dignities of their communities.""\nPatricia Cochran is an Inupiat Eskimo born and raised in Nome, Alaska.

The fifth appears to be on its way.\nFirst, in taking the oath of office, a president promises to \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully execute the laws & the constitution."" That\'s Article II Section 2.\nBut Trump is unfaithfully executing his duties as president by accusing his predecessor, president Obama, of undertaking an illegal and impeachable act, with absolutely no evidence to support the accusation.\nSecond, Article I Section 9 of the Constitution forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments. But Trump is making big money off his Trump International Hotel by steering foreign diplomatic delegations to it, and will make a bundle off China\'s recent decision to grant his trademark applications for the Trump brand \xe2\x80\x93 decisions Chinese authorities arrived at directly because of decisions Trump has made as president.\nThird: The 1st Amendment to the Constitution bars any law \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" But Trump\'s ban on travel into the United States from 6 muslim countries \xe2\x80\x93 which he initiated, advocated for, and oversees \xe2\x80\x93 violates that provision.\nFourth: The 1st Amendment also bars \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of the press."" But Trump\'s labeling the press \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemy of the people,"" and choosing who he invites to news conferences based on whether they\'ve given him favorable coverage, violates this provision.\nA fifth possible ground if the evidence is there: Article II Section 3 of the Constitution defines \xe2\x80\x9ctreason against the United States"" as \xe2\x80\x9cadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.""\nEvidence is mounting that Trump and his aides colluded with Russian operatives to win the 2016 presidential election.\nPresidents can be impeached for what the Constitution calls \xe2\x80\x9chigh crimes and misdemeanors."" The question is no longer whether there are grounds to impeach Trump. The practical question is whether there\'s the political will.\n**More details coming!

At the time the U.S. was founded, its female citizens did not share all of the same rights as men, including the right to vote. It was not until 1848 that the movement for women's rights launched on a national level with a convention in Seneca Falls, New York, organized by abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) and Lucretia Mott (1793-1880). Following the convention, the demand for the vote became a centerpiece of the women's rights movement. Stanton and Mott, along with Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) and other activists, formed organizations that raised public awareness and lobbied the government to grant voting rights to women. After a 70-year battle, these groups finally emerged victorious with the passage of the 19th Amendment.\nNOTE : If you are one of over 3,000 officially registered Indivisible Groups via\nindivisibleguide.com\nand are interested in organizing to host and promote the Indivisible Suffragette Sisters 19th Amendment Anniversary March as an Event in your area please contact the Board of Directors and message for more information on the ISS Facebook Page.\nLINK :\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/SUFFRAGETTESISTERSANDBROTHERS/about/?ref=page_internal\nFurther Description : TBA""",2017-06-05 20:46:36.967539,,,19TH AMENDMENT 100TH ANNIVERSARY MARCH,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Suggest Edit,['https://facebook.com/events/206869993130547'],risestronger.org,['Civil Rights and Civil Liberties'],[],https://risestronger.org/events/19th-amendment-100th-anniversary-march

The fifth appears to be on its way.\nFirst, in taking the oath of office, a president promises to \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully execute the laws & the constitution."" That\'s Article II Section 2.\nBut Trump is unfaithfully executing his duties as president by accusing his predecessor, president Obama, of undertaking an illegal and impeachable act, with absolutely no evidence to support the accusation.\nSecond, Article I Section 9 of the Constitution forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments. But Trump is making big money off his Trump International Hotel by steering foreign diplomatic delegations to it, and will make a bundle off China\'s recent decision to grant his trademark applications for the Trump brand \xe2\x80\x93 decisions Chinese authorities arrived at directly because of decisions Trump has made as president.\nThird: The 1st Amendment to the Constitution bars any law \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" But Trump\'s ban on travel into the United States from 6 muslim countries \xe2\x80\x93 which he initiated, advocated for, and oversees \xe2\x80\x93 violates that provision.\nFourth: The 1st Amendment also bars \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of the press."" But Trump\'s labeling the press \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemy of the people,"" and choosing who he invites to news conferences based on whether they\'ve given him favorable coverage, violates this provision.\nA fifth possible ground if the evidence is there: Article II Section 3 of the Constitution defines \xe2\x80\x9ctreason against the United States"" as \xe2\x80\x9cadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.""\nEvidence is mounting that Trump and his aides colluded with Russian operatives to win the 2016 presidential election.\nPresidents can be impeached for what the Constitution calls \xe2\x80\x9chigh crimes and misdemeanors.""

"Jun 25, 2017  3:00 PM - Jun 25, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'A day before International Day in Solidarity with Victims of Torture:\nJOIN US IN MIAMI TO PROTEST AGAINST TRUMP AND HIS TORTURE PRISON.\nDonald Trump has said he wants to revive and expand US use of torture. On Guantanamo, he said he wants to keep the prison open and ""load it up with some bad dudes"".  Now, more than ever, is the time for us to stand against these crimes against humanity. President Obama broke his promise - 41 men remain imprisoned at Guantanamo. A powerful movement against torture and illegal detention is their best chance for justice.\nFifteen years ago, the United States brought the first detainees to Guantanamo Bay. The detention center has since then become a place of torture and shame. Released detainees claimed that waterboarding, sexual humiliation, and forced drugging were used on prisoners. Six detainees have committed suicide.\nSince January 11 2001, 775 men have been sent to Guantanamo Bay without trial and have been jailed without ever having been charged with any crime. As of March 2017, 41 prisoners remain locked up. A horrific torture prison created under George Bush remains up and running under President Trump, despite Barack Obama\'s infinite promises to the American people that he would shut it down.\nWikileaks produced documents from the US government stating that at least 150 Afghanis and Pakistanis detained in Guantanamo were never a risk at all, were brought in by mistake or for no clear reason, and then were held without due process for years. These innocent people include a camera man from Al Jazeera and a 70 year old with dementia with ""no reason on record"" for being held. They have been separated from their families and subjected to cruel treatment for absolutely no reason.\nWE SAY NO MORE!\nJoin us in Miami on this terrible anniversary as we march to the headquarters of Southern Command, the center that operates Guantanamo Bay military base and detention center, and demand that fifteen years of torture and shame come to an end!'",2017-06-05 20:48:02.995612,"9301 NW 33rd St, Doral, FL, 33172","https://www.google.com/maps?q=25.8049792,-80.3503638",SHUT DOWN TRUMP'S TORTURE PRISON AT GUANTANAMO!,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM),['https://facebook.com/events/394487687583928'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/shut-down-trump-s-torture-prison-at-guantanamo

We've Done our Share: Time to Clean Up Savannah River Site Not Dump More Waste on Us!\nSpecial interests are lurking that would like to profit off bringing highly radioactive commercial waste to the Savannah River Site for indefinite storage.  This dangerous waste - commercial spent nuclear fuel from US nuclear power plants and a special form of spent fuel from Germany - could be brought to the DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken.  But public opposition could derail these dangerous plans to turn SRS into an international waste dump.\nThe SRS Citizens Advisory Board, (a formal panel that advises DOE on clean-up of SRS) has before it this summer two draft recommendations against the waste import.  These recommendations will be raised and likely voted on at the CAB's Nuclear Materials Committee on the evening of June 6 in Aiken. We need a strong showing by the public at the meeting to oppose the waste import and to support the recommendations.\n______________\nSee the draft recommendations linked here:\nRecommendation against interim or long-term storage of commercial spent fuel:  https://tinyurl.com/lxl5wpn\nRecommendation against import of German spent fuel (via Charleston): https://tinyurl.com/mjm9x5z\n______________\nLet the SRS Citizens Advisory Board know that South Carolina doesn't want to be dumped on with highly radioactive waste from other states or from abroad.  Speak up in favor of two recommendations on this matter.\nWhen:  Tuesday, June 6, SRS CAB's Nuclear Materials Committee meeting, 6:30 - 8:20 p.m.  The recommendations are likely to be discussed at the full CAB meeting on July 24-25 in Aiken so we will also need to be there to speak in favor of the recommendations.\nWhere: About 5 miles south of downtown Aiken -\nDOE Meeting Center\n230 Village Green Blvd.\nSuite 220\nAiken, SC 29803\nSee SRS CAB website for more details and schedule:  http://www.srs.gov/general/outreach/srs-cab/srs-cab.html\nFor information and more background on nuclear waste and other issues related to SRS, visits SRS Watch  at http://www.srswatch.org""",2017-06-05 20:48:16.881664,"230 Village Green Blvd, Aiken, SC 29803-1718","https://www.google.com/maps?q=33.4932603,-81.746789","SAY ""NO!""

Article 2, Section 1.8. of the Constitution Sets forth the oath of office:  \xe2\x80\x9cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""\nIn his conduct of the Office of President of the United States, Trump in violation of his oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of the Unites States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice in that he:\n1a.\tInterfered with the Department of Justice of the United States and Federal Bureau of Investigation by dismissing officers and investigators conducting investigations as to his illegal activities, including Preet Bharara the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Salley Yates, the Deputy and Acting Attorney General of the United States, and James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n1b.\tMade false and misleading statements the people of the United States to deceive the people that investigations as to his misdeeds and those of his subordinates were and are being conducted thoroughly and completely with regard to his misconduct and the misconduct of his subordinate\n1c.\tFailed to provide information regarding General Flynn\'s dealings with the Russians to the House Intelligence Committee.\n(2) Violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause Article I, Section 9, Clause 8\n[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\nThe framers of the Constitution created this clause to ensure that US officials would not be corrupted by gifts or payments from foreign powers, yet President Trump receives a constant stream of cash and favors from foreign powers and their agents.\nInconsistent with the practice of all modern era Presidents and the expectations of the public, he has refused to place his business assets into a blind trust in which he would have no control over the assets and decision making of his businesses, but instead, directly and/or through his family continues to control his businesses and receive business revenues. The single largest tenant of Trump Tower is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a wholly state-owned company. The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority office holds a lease with Trump Tower. Foreign diplomats and foreign embassy events at Washington\'s Trump International Hotel. More than an obvious conflict of interest, receipt of any monies by him or his businesses under his control of him or his family from any foreign government or representative of a foreign government is a present or emolument in direct violation of the United States Constitution.\nTrump has financial relationships with businesses and governments throughout the world, including Turkey, the Philippines, India, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Viet Nam.  Most importantly, he has financial dealings with Russia and China, the extent of which are largely unknown and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns as has been done by all modern era Presidents, a promise upon which he reneged.\nThese conflicts of interest have not only enriched Trump, buy have undermined our national security.\n(3)\tViolation of the Free speech rights of the citizens and the press.\nHas denied access to the White House by certain members of the press and publicly villified the press by calling them enemies of the people in violation of the First Amendment Rights of the people and his duty to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n(4)\tTreason.  Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution defines treason in part as giving \xe2\x80\x9cAid and comfort"" to our enemies.\nBy condoning hacking by the Russian Government of a major political party and encouraging dissemination of hacked materials for purposes of political gain and by condoning unauthorized, unsecured meetings with Russia and other governments he has breached the security of the United States.\n(5) Libeled and slandered the former President of the United States with criminal intent.\nTrump maliciously and intentionally maligned President Obama by accusing the former President of wiretapping him. Making a false allegation of a crime is a crime.\n(6) Issuance of a travel ban in Violation of the Equal Protection  Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\n6a.\t The order singles out persons because of their religious preference in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6b.\t Because the order bans individuals from specific Muslim countries, it establishes a religious test in violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n6c.\tThe travel ban gives the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited powers without procedural protections in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nDonald Trump\'s extreme disregard for the Constitution is a profound subversion of the Office of the President. Neither do we feel our country is in safe nor able hands, and we will not quietly ride out a tenure that threatens our democracy and way of life. We demand that Congress stop enabling President Trump through an embarrassing and potentially catastrophic charade of normalcy. The future of American Democracy rests in their hands.\nCONGRESS: DO YOUR JOB, OR LOSE YOUR JOB.\nIMPEACH DONALD TRUMP NOW.'",2017-06-05 20:49:37.683679,"200 N Spring St Ste 101, Los Angeles, CA, 90012","https://www.google.com/maps?q=34.0534768,-118.2428934",IMPEACHMENT MARCH - LOS ANGELES,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Los Angeles City Hall,['https://facebook.com/events/1981311842088671'],risestronger.org,[],[],https://risestronger.org/events/impeachment-march-los-angeles-d1479638-26da-49dd-8a10-f73ba152344c
