BETSY DEVOS SCRIPT
Hello (NAME OF SENATOR) my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to ask that my representative not confirm Betsy Devos for Secretary of Education.
During the confirmation process, Ms. Devos has showed she is?embarrassingly unqualified. She?doesn't know the difference between proficiency and growth and she has wrong ideas for the?education of our children. Her support for vouchers is misplaced and she has no experience working in a public school?environment.
I care deeply education policy, and our children's futures are at stake. I?will be watching if my representative votes to confirm Betsy Devos, and if they do, I will not be voting for them come the next election.",2017-06-06 21:02:52.327511,,,URGENT!

YOU'RE A ROTTEN ONE, MR. TRUMP.
TRUMP HOLDS MILLIONS OF LIVES HOSTAGE FOR HIS WALL.
As we wrote about yesterday, Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants his wall paid for, and he is willing to go to great lengths to get it.
Reports indicate he has threatened Congressional Democrats that unless they balk and support the wall's funding, the White House will stop funding subsidies for Obamacare, effectively causing it to crash down.

TRUMP'S WALL SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I have learned the Trump Administration has threatened Democrats that unless they support Congressional funding for Trump's Wall, the White House will cease making subsidy payments to bring the Affordable Care Act?crashing down.
?This tactic did?not?work with the previous attempt to replace ObamaCare and it shouldn't work now. Using the lives of millions of people who rely on healthcare to serve as a gambling chip for a wall we don't need is bad policy.
This will?effectively threaten a program that over 17 million of our most vulnerable citizens rely on.
I please ask that my representative stand up against blatant attempts of political blackmail and say no to a wall we don't need and can't afford.

THE INTELLIGENCE PANEL'S INVESTIGATION MUST LOOK AT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND ITS PARTNERSHIPS
(
[Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/wyden-follow-money-russia-trump-organization)
) During a hearing on Thursday for the Senate Intelligence Committee's probe into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) called on the panel to investigate the finances of President Donald Trump and his associates.
Wyden said that a ""key to a successful investigation is following the money,"" specifying that the probe should look into entities associated with the Trump Organization.
..
""It is already a matter of public record that entities associated with Donald Trump have been the subject of millions of dollars of fines for willful repeated and long standing violations of anti-money laundering laws,"" the senator said during the hearing.

TRUMP MONEY SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to echo statements made by your colleague, Senator Ron Wyden.
Wyden, a Republican, stated Tuesday?that a key to a successful investigation of Russia's impact on the 2016 election is to follow the money on Trump's business?dealings, specifying that the probe should look into entities associated with the Trump Organization.
It is already a matter of public record that entities associated with Donald Trump have been the subject of millions of dollars of fines for willful repeated and long standing violations of anti-money laundering laws.

SCRIPT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP/DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
Dear President Trump,
As you know, an estimated 4.6 million men and women alike came together?across the country this past Saturday in solidarity for the Women's March.
The unity principals for The?Women's March on Washington advocate equal pay for women, access to affordable childcare, sick days, healthcare, paid family leave and healthy working environments: policies that benefit men as well.
I was troubled and saddened to learn so soon after the march that the White House plans to 25 Violence Against Women grants at the Department of Justice.
The grants, established by 1994?s Violence Against Women Act and other federal legislation, go to organizations working to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and elder abuse.
We please ask that you refrain from cutting these programs or provide an?adequate replacement.

After a leak revealed that Michael Flynn was not being truthful about his contacts with Russia, Trump has vowed to fight back.
""[Trump] is clearly upset about?this, he understands the threat it poses to?our national security and he?s going to?make sure he continues to?make sure that that stops,"" Spicer told reporters regarding the issue of?leaks...

President Trump already has a?shaky record with the Whistleblower Protection Act. There was a bipartisan response slamming gag orders he placed on department officials.
According to the
[Government Accountability Project](https://www.whistleblower.org/blog/110226-trump-launches-illegal-blitzkrieg-whistleblower-protection-act)
:
""On (Trump's) second day in office, a series of agencies issued gag orders that are incompatible with four provisions of the (Whistleblower Protection Act), two longstanding appropriations spending bans, a century old shield on congressional communications, and the First Amendment. They were issued at the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. So far, they appear primarily to target scientists and other professionals. They range from restrictions on social media, to blanket restraints on all communications, including Congress.""
""What is The?Whistleblower Protection Act?
It?prohibits retaliation against federal employees, applicants, or former employees for disclosing the following types of government wrongdoing:
- a violation of any law, rule, or regulation.
- gross mismanagement;
- gross waste of funds;
- abuse of authority; or
- a substantial or specific danger to public health or safety.
(5 U.S.C. ? 2302(b)(8). ?It also protected exercising an?an employee?s right to blow the whistle, or to file, assist,or participate in a complaint, appeal, or grievance. ?See 5 U.S.C. ? 2302."" (The National Law?Review - See

Instead, the

(ICWPA) permits IC employees to report an ?urgent concern? (even if it involves classified information) to the agency?s Inspector General and, ultimately, to the congressional intelligence committees. Remarkably, though, the ICWPA does not provide employees protection against retaliation if they make such disclosures.""

""
Contrary to popular belief, the fact that a person?s disclosures might be protected under the WPA, ICWPA, or PPD-19 does not constitute a defense against criminal prosecution. It merely shields the employee from being fired or other forms of adverse personnel action

SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I believe the government is not doing enough to examine the Trump Administration's connection with Russia.
I am calling on the Senate Intelligence Committee to begin an investigation ?into potential Russian ties within the White House and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.
?
I would like to express my support for Chairman Burr's apparent decision to pursue this matter. It has been announced that the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested that Russia-related materials from over a dozen agencies, organizations, and individuals preserved.There are many reasons why it's a good idea:
National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after potentially inappropriate conversations with the Kremlin. As many as three top officials of the Trump Administration have financial ties with Russia. There are swirling allegations that Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with Russia during his campaign.
I please ask the Committee take up the slack left by the inaction of the House Oversight Committee. The American public deserves the truth.

Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today to make sure the investigation into potential Russian ties with the Trump Administration is made the full priority of Congress until it is resolved.
This week, our news headlines were?dominated with the GOP?healthcare bill, the budget, and North Korea posturing
, but I feel that Congress must keep the Russian Investigation and its results an absolute priority.
It is no secret the House inquiry has been plagued by missteps. The most notable was Rep.?Devin Nunes decision to share intelligence with the White House he was supposed to be investigating.?While the Senate investigative committee has pledged a thorough probe, it?s
[done little so far](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/23/senate-trump-russia-probe-has-no-full-time-staff-no-key-witnesses.html)
. It has held no high-profile hearings. Congress MUST do more, or I will remember my representatives inaction when I head to the polls the next election.

THE PRESIDENT WANTS MORE POWER. HIS IGNORANCE MAKES CONGRESS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT.
FACISIM REARS IT'S UGLY HEAD IN AMERICA, AND IT'S FRIGHTENING.
Last
week, President Trump argued he should have more power when dealing with Congress ""
because he's 'a closer.'""
""You look at the rules of the Senate, even the rules of the House, but the rule of the Senate and some of the things you have to go through, it's really a bad thing for the country in my opinion,"" Trump told
Fox News
on April 28.
?
Trump further argued for ?""tak[ing] those rules on"" such as the Senate filibuster ""because for the good of the nation things are going to have to be different."" He added, ""You can't go through a process like this. It's not fair, it forces you to make bad decisions"" (USA Today).
We disagree Mr. Trump. We think these rules protect our country FROM a bad decision...you.

TRUMP'S LIMITED POWER SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I disagree with President Trump's comments that he should be given more authority in his dealings with the Congress. I?believe strongly in the checks and balances imposed on our branches of government and I am weary of talk of any measure that change that.
I also do not agree with the president that Congress should lose its filibuster. As Adlai Stevenson said, ""Democracy is great not only because majority rules, but it's safe to be in the minority."" By signaling out the actions of minority representation, we start on a slippery slope that leads to a political reality that should never exist in America.
Now is the time for Congress to step up to the plate. It should hold hearings and debate military operations, it should craft?infrastructure and healthcare plans independent of Trump's twitter?meanderings.* Our Founders?felt strongly to protect our?separation of powers, and so do I.
*
Donald Trump says Congress has too much power. He's wrong.

REMOVE NUNES FROM THE RUSSIA/TRUMP ""INVESTIGATION"" NOW.
HE IS UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN HIS COMMITTEE'S INQUIRY
While Devin Nunes (R-Calif) is investigating what is perhaps ""the
biggest political scandal since Watergate: Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and whether Donald Trump?s campaign colluded with, or was somehow compromised by, the Russians,"" he has failed us by seemingly putting politics before his country.
When ""Nunes learned that communications involving members of Trump?s transition team, and possibly Trump himself, had been picked up incidentally during U.S. surveillance of foreigners.?Did Nunes immediately brief the top Democrat on the panel, his fellow Californian Adam Schiff?
No. Instead, he rushed over to the White House and told Trump,""
the very subject of his supposed ""investigation.""
As USA Today states, ""what?s crucial is that Congress provide an honest, credible examination into the Russian connection. Nunes? bad instincts undermine public confidence that his panel can conduct such an inquiry...Congress must show it?s capable of following this path of suspicion, whether it leads nowhere or to the Oval Office. That requires putting the inquiry in the hands of people with reputations for integrity and independence, not administration apologists.""

THE GOP HAS ATTACKED THE HEALTH ORGANIZATION.
(
[TIME](http://time.com/money/4692943/the-gops-obamacare-replacement-cuts-funding-for-planned-parenthood/)
): ""House Republicans have at long last unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the
[Affordable Care Act](http://time.com/money/4565468/womens-health-care-president-trump/)
, and it includes a provision to defund Planned Parenthood, the largest network provider of women's health care in the country.
The GOP's
[health plan](http://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/AmericanHealthCareAct.pdf)
?dubbed the American Health Care Act, or AHCA? released Monday night, restricts fundings to organizations that provide abortions except in the case of rape, incest, or health of the mother. Planned Parenthood currently receives
[40% of its operating budget](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2114/5089/0863/2014-2015_PPFA_Annual_Report_.pdf)
?or around $500 million?from the federal government, none of which can be used for abortion services thanks to the
[Hyde Amendment](http://time.com/tag/hyde-amendment/)
.
In fact, 60% of Planned Parenthood's federal funding comes from reimbursements from Medicaid and Title X funding for preventative and primary care (things like birth control and cancer screenings).
""The Government Accountability Office
[estimates](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/09/08/quantifying-planned-parenthoods-critical-role-in-meeting-the-need-for-publicly-supported-contraceptive-care/)

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I am calling today because enough is enough. The DOJ must announce that they have begun the process of appointing a Special Counsel to investigate the Trump Administration's Russian ties.
It appears that Attorney General Sessions misled the Congress under Oath when he stated he ""did not have communications with the Russians. Now, we know the Attorney General met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat - the same person whose interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing.
If these allegations are true, I believe Attorney General Sessions should resign for the good of the country. The Attorney General is responsible to uphold the truth. In that purpose, he has failed us.
?
While Attorney General Sessions claimed he planned on recusing himself from an investigation, I am growing weary at empty promises. The Department of Justice should appoint a Special Council today. It would be an unfathomable conflict of interest to have the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General oversee proceedings as political appointees. An independent investigation is absolutely necessary in this case and is long over due.

TRUMP'S RUSSIA SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I?believe?the President's comments that he fired James Comey in the middle of an active investigation because he felt it was ""made up"" likely amounted to obstruction of justice. I think it has a chilling effect on the future of presidential oversight and is?frighteningly?reminiscent to Richard Nixon's Saturday Massacre.
I do not like the timing at all. It?occurred?almost?immediately after it was announced that a grand jury and?subpoenas were on the horizon. If it is shown that Sessions and Rosenstein cooked up a false reason to get?rid of Comey because the president was displeased with Comey's investigation,
this was nothing less than a baldfaced attempt to interfere with a legitimate investigation of the executive branch.
While the President has the?right to fire Comey, the circumstances might mean he has breached his oath in doing so. This reeks of a scheme to mislead the American people and prevent discovery of his possible misconduct violates his oath of office. If he is engaged in such conduct, he is no longer acting to enforce and execute the laws of the United States and Congress should take a closer look at impeachment.*

, President Trump?s first three trips to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach have cost the federal treasury -- American taxpayers -- as much as $10 million within just the first month of his presidency. By the end of his term, that number could total hundreds of millions of dollars.""
On a related note, the city of New York pays roughly $500,000 per day securing Trump Tower, where First Lady Melania Trump and son Barron are currently living. The annual cost could end up being around $183 million for this alone.
Meanwhile, Trump has put forth one of the stingiest budget proposals: ""
Trump's budget would cut off funding entirely for several agencies, including arts, public broadcasting and development groups, and also proposes steep cuts to agencies like the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency."" (

National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, two agencies Trump?s budget blueprint has targeted for elimination. I?believe strongly in the arts - so many of our nation's children have grown up watching programs like Sesame Street. These cuts ignore the fabric of what we represent.

AS KUSHNER CASTS A SHADOW OVER THE SECRETARY OF STATE, QUESTIONS STILL SURROUND HIS MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA.
""Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was hired to be America?s top diplomat, but less than three months on the job has proven he is definitely not. As president of Exxon Mobil, Tillerson, 65, was one of the most powerful people in the world, enjoying lucrative work away from the spotlight. A few months later, the secretary of state has found himself in a job-share with a 36-year-old foreign policy neophyte married to the president?s daughter.""
""Tillerson had vast experience with the Chinese at Exxon Mobil, yet the summit at Mar-a-Lago in Florida this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping was Jared?s project. Indeed, he raced back from a surprise trip to Iraq -- beating Tillerson to the critical hot spot -- to oversee it."" (

JARED KUSHNER SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I believe?Congress is not?doing enough to get to the bottom of the Trump Administration's potential Russian ties.
While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was hired to be America's top diplomat, it couldn't be more obvious that he shares his role with Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law.?While Tillerson had vast experience with China as the CEO of Exxon Mobil,?Kushner led the project. He was also first to visit Iraq, beating Tillerson to oversee it. While the?president can choose his aids, recent questions about information omitted by Kushner on his clearance?questionnaire makes his shadow post a cause for concern.
Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months, and crucially, that?includes a December meeting with Russian?ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak (SIR-GAY KISS-LIE-AK) , and the head of a Russia state-owned bank, arranged by Kislyak
(KISS-LIE-AK)
. These questions must be answered swiftly if Kushner is to have such an important role in our foreign
policy.

IT'S TIME THE GOP PRESENTS TRUMP WITH A DEAL.
MAKE TRUMP'S LIFE GREAT AGAIN WITH AN OFFER HE CAN'T REFUSE.

of the
[The Daily Intelligencer](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/republicans-should-offer-trump-a-golden-parachute.html)
wrote a humous piece about some of the things Donald Trump would prefer to have over being president to entice him to resign. That list includes funding for a new season of the Apprentice
and forcing Obama to lose to him during a game of golf.
But what if there was truth to the humor?
""After all, Trump seems to be as disappointed with the realities of his presidency as anyone in Congress. Virtually?every story?about the reality star?s life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue paints a portrait of anxious exhaustion and paranoid rage. In press interviews, Trump has expressed an open desire to return to the relative tranquility of his pre-political existence."" (
[Levitz](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/republicans-should-offer-trump-a-golden-parachute.html)

We think the time is rapidly approaching where the GOP should consider presenting Trump with a deal that would allow him to resign quickly and?quietly. The Russia investigation has already been going on for 10 months - It has become clear that it will only get worse and more destructive of Trump's agenda. What is the only thing that would counter balance the ego trip of the century?
A simple deal.

TRUMP DEAL TRIP SCRIPT
?Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am calling because I am very troubled by the
considerable?lengths?President Trump has allegedly gone to interfere with and quash the Russian investigation. Between firing Comey and admitting to Russian officials he did so to?relieve?pressure - and now reports that the President
contacted NSA and intelligence officials in an attempt?sabotage an active FBI investigation, it is difficult to imagine how this does not qualify as a blatant obstruction.
Our country has now been plunged into a debacle that President Trump cannot recover from. He has lost the faith of over?half the country, and polling shows more Americans want him impeached than do not. This catastrophic failure in leadership only promises to embroil our country even deeper into this nightmare. President Trump has now hired an attorney. It is clear his agenda will be marred by this scandal for the coming months, and it threatens to bring the GOP down with him.
We think the time is rapidly approaching where the GOP should consider presenting Trump with a deal that would allow him to resign quickly and?quietly. A simple deal.??Trump resigns, and saves?himself and his son-in-law from what's to come. It will save the GOP from further

OBAMACARE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the Affordable Care Act and REJECT the plan to replace it.
""Reapealing and Replacing"" ObamaCare is a playing politics with people's lives. What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws.
The GOP?s new plan would reduce the government?s role in helping people afford health insurance and would likely leave
[millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html)
without it. Between 6 million and 10 million people would lose coverage, according to
[initial estimates](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/7/14844446/standard-poors-sp-ahca-obamacare-repeal-replace)
by Standard & Poor?s.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If you vote for a repeal to ObamaCare without an immediate replacement, I will not be voting for you come the next election.

TRUMP BUDGET SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today to oppose the many cuts President Trump has proposed in his budget.
President Trump?s proposed budget blueprint eliminates funding for important government programs. Today I stand with the
National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, two agencies Trump?s budget blueprint has targeted for elimination. I?believe strongly in the arts - so many of our nation's children have grown up watching programs like Sesame Street. These cuts ignore the fabric of what we represent.
President Trump's budget blueprint also eliminates funding for Meals on Wheels, a program that provides meals for the poor, elderly and veterans.
Our country is founded upon compassion. This budget is a step back for this nation, and I am calling on my Representatives to reject it.

Yesterday,

McCarthy also criticized the Trump administration for removing years of data from the agency?s public website.

ENVIRONMENT SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today in support of comments made last evening by Gina McCarthy, the EPA?head under former President Obama.
I?do not support the EPA's intention to continue to cut regulations. As McCarthy stated, these rules benefit normal human?beings. I fear for the impact Climate Change could have on future generations of Americans.
In addition, I do not support the EPA's moves to wipe the historical record of what the agency has done for decades. The website has been stricken of information that is deserving to be in the?public. I urge my representative to?defend our environment from corporate assaults. The future of our country depends on it.

HEALTH CARE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the most important provisions of Affordable Care Act and REJECT any plan that would eliminate protections for those with preexisting?conditions. I want my representative to vote AGAINST TrumpCare.
The new Republican amendment, introduced Tuesday night, would allow states to waive out of ObamaCare?s ban on preexisting conditions. This means that insurers could once again, under certain circumstances, charge sick people higher premiums than healthy people.
What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws.
The GOP?s new plan would reduce the government?s role in helping people afford health insurance and would likely leave
[millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html)
without it. Between 6 million and 10 million people would have lost coverage if the last plan was passed. What's more, Tom MacArthur's amendment allows Congress and their stadd to keep ObamaCare regulations. That is wrong.

""President Donald Trump has reorganized the National Security Council?elevating his chief political strategist, Steve Bannon, and demoting the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

SCRIPT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
Dear President Trump,
(1)
I am writing today to join my name with the many National Security experts and?citizens alike who oppose Steve Bannon's appointment to the National Security Council.
Your demotion of the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has the potential to remove two crucial voices in the NSC's principals committee,
the top inter-agency group advising the president on national security.
Political strategists have never before participated in National Security Council principals meetings, because the NSC is supposed to give presidents nonpartisan, factual advice.
You have claimed your actions are intended to keep us safe, but I?believe this appointment promises to do the exact?opposite while politicizing the NSC.
I also oppose?Bannon's former?allegiance to Breitbart News, a far-right media outlet that has promoted conspiracy theories and is a platform for the alt-right movement, which espouses white nationalism.
Please?don't just take my word for it:
Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice calls the move ?stone cold crazy.? Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who also served under President George W. Bush, says the demotions are a ?big mistake.?
(2)
I am also writing because I was incredibly troubled to learn the Trump Administration has not fully complied with court orders regarding your recent travel ban.
A White House official was quoted by NBC News as saying ""s
aturday?s ruling does not undercut the president?s executive order.
All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited.?
CBP officials also

to obey the Virginia judge?s order to allow lawyers access to detainees at Dulles. ?It?s not going to happen,?
[they told attorneys who hoped to represent the detained people](https://twitter.com/DamonSilvers/status/825747937066115072)
. When Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) showed up at the airport shortly before midnight Saturday, CBP officials refused to meet with him, according to

.
Disobeying a court order ?is a big deal for any government official ? federal, state, local, executive, legislative, whatever,? said Abner Greene, a law professor at Fordham University. ?Obedience to specific court orders is what keeps us from being a banana republic or fascist dictatorship. That?s a really big deal.?
I believe strongly that those detained should be granted representation and court orders should be followed to the letter.
I will be continuing to voice my concerns on this issue and will work on discussing these issues with other constituents to ensure attention to this matter.

This letter is sent on behalf of concerned citizens who believe our government is not doing enough to examine the Trump?administration's relationship with Russia and how it affects National Security.
We are?calling on the committee chairman agree to look into recent allegations that?President Trump's National Security?Advisor may have spoke about sanctions with Vladimir Putin before the election.
I am aware Chairperson Chaffetz has recommended an ethics review into Kelly Anne Conway's promotion of Ivanka Trump's clothing line from the White House?briefing room. But we need to go even further.
Now, the FBI has announced it has begun an investigation regarding conversations National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had with?Vladimir Putin.
There were also allegations that President Trump may have colluded with Russia during his campaign and these reports have been largely ignored by the Oversight Committee.
We believe Chairman Chaffetz has also failed to?adequately?review President Trump's?business conflicts of interest and potential collusion with Russia.
By not doing his job, Representative Chaffetz is delivering a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation. If he is?unwilling to look further into these pressing matters for political reasons, he should step aside.

CALL TO ACTIVISM FOR DEMOCRACY
!
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER PUSH: LET'S POP THE AIRBAG OF TRUMP'S CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
?THE PRESIDENT'S POTENTIAL CONFLICTS ARE UNPRECEDENTED - SO IS CONGRESS' INACTION.
Yesterday, we left the U.S. Office of Government Ethics Director, Walter Shaub, hundreds of messages for support for his vocal stance that Trump should divest.
Let's do it again.

TRUMP CONFLICT OF INTEREST SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE].
I am calling because I feel the government is NOT doing enough to examine?Donald Trump's innumerable potential conflicts of interest.
I know that Director Shaub has been vocal about Donald Trump's need to divest his business and I wholeheartedly?support his efforts to provide independent oversight of the Trump Administration, particularly when Representative Chaffetz and the House Oversight Committee has refused to take on the very real danger of Trump's conflicts of interest.
Billionaire Donald Trump presents a unique?challenge to oversight as his business dealings spread across domestic and international spheres. It is?imperative an?inquiry is started immediately to ensure the integrity of our system.
I hope that Director Shaub stands up to any attempt to silence his efforts, and he remains vocal and louder than ever.

Hello Senator (NAME OF SENATOR) my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the Affordable Care Act.
""Reapealing and Replacing"" ObamaCare is a playing politics with people's lives. What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws which
should come into effect IMMEDIATELY if the ACA is repealed.
In addition, the replacement that the Congress considers should include the most beneficial parts of the ACA, including
1)
Guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions
2) Elimination of gender discrimination
3)?Having Young Adults remain on their parents' plan until they are 26.
and
4) Leaving the?changes to Medicare alone!
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake.

Republicans have pushed the GOP health care?overhaul past an initial procedural hurdle in the House.
Friday?s procedural vote was 230-194. That moves the chamber toward a climactic final vote that?s a big gamble for President Donald Trump and congressional leaders.
The early vote inserted changes into the measure that leaders hoped would win over unhappy Republicans. It would improve?Medicaid benefits for some older and handicapped people and abolish coverage requirements President Barack Obama?s 2010 law imposes on insurers.
It remained uncertain whether GOP leaders?had enough votes to prevail on final passage.""

HEALTH CARE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the Affordable Care Act and REJECT the plan to replace it.
Reapealing and Replacing"" ObamaCare is a playing politics with people's lives. What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws.
The GOP?s new plan would reduce the government?s role in helping people afford health insurance and would likely leave
[millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html)
without it. Between 6 million and 10 million people would lose coverage. The bill also places a
cap on Medicaid funding based on the number of enrollees. This will?effectively harm a program that over 17 million of our most vulnerable citizens rely on.
I am calling on you to reject this Health Bill and instead?focuses on positive changes to the existing law.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If my Representative supports this Health Care bill I will not be voting for them come reelection.

TRUMP'S TAXES SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to ask that the chairman of the committee begins an inquiry and examines President Trump's tax returns.
Billionaire Donald Trump presents a unique challenge to oversight as his business dealings spread across domestic and international spheres. One of the strongest foundations of our country is the premise of government oversight and accountability to the public.
By not releasing his tax returns, the President is sending a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation.

Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I believe Congress must stand up to President Trump's threats of government shutdown and deliver a budget him to sign before the deadline this Friday.
Reports indicate that the Trump Administration has urged Republicans to use the threat of a government shutdown to push for funding of the border wall.

Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today in support of the Affordable Care Act. I?believe?the GOP Health Care?Bill simply does not go far enough to protect the most vulnerable Americans.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Republican bill will result in 24 million fewer people having health insurance by 2026, compared to Obama's 2010 statute. The money set aside for Medicare and those Patients with pre-existing conditions won't cut it.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If my representative votes for this replacement without improvements, I will not be voting for them come the next election.

NUNES MUST RECUSE HIMSELF.
Top Democrats have now begun to weigh in on the need for Nunes to recuse himself, but you, our trusty warriors of Call to Activism, connected the?dots on Nunes long before the rest.
For the past few days, we have called on Congress to replace Nunes. Our calls are working. Yesterday,?Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, weighed in in agreement:
""We've reached the point, after the events of this week, where it would be very difficult to maintain the credibility of the investigation if the chairman did not recuse himself from matters involving either the Trump campaign or the Trump transition team of which he was a member"" (

DEVIN NUNES SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to call on my Representative to do everything in their power to have Devin Nunes removed from his committee's
inquiry?into
Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and whether Donald Trump?s campaign colluded with, or was somehow compromised by, the Russians.
There are a number of reasons Nunes must recuse?himself: he acted?inappropriately when he rushed to the White House to brief the president, the very subject of his investigation, to share intelligence he discovered before sharing it with his committee. He has cancelled an important meeting with Sally Yates after it became apparent her testimony would be damaging. Yesterday, it was revealed he met his source at the White House, leading to questions whether he coordinated with Trump's team.
It is crucial that Congress provide an honest, credible examination into the Russian connection. Nunes? bad instincts have undermined public confidence that his panel can conduct such an inquiry.

SCRIPT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP/ SEAN SPICER
Dear President Trump and Press?Secretary Sean Spicer,
?I wanted to express my utter?disappointment in Mr. Spicer's press briefing yesterday evening.
First, I was struck by the fact that the government has chosen to address such a?small and petty issue while so many real concerns face our nation.
Second, Mr. Spicer's demeanor was harsh and uncalled for. The media's job is for oversight and we do not welcome such a hostile environment for our press corps.
Finally, the evidence simply does not support Mr. Spicer's ""alternative facts"" for the number of people who attended the?inauguration. The Press?Secretary must maintain a special relationship with the People based on trust - if he continues to spread misinformation so easily disputed, he will harm an important buffer between the American people and their government.

""
Allowing states to opt out of essential health benefits could also hurt sicker people because while they can still buy a plan, it may not cover some of the services they need such as prescription drugs or hospitalization. They might have to pay extra for those services.

Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I believe the government is not doing enough to examine the Trump Administration's connection with Russia.
I am calling on the Senate Judiciary Committee to begin an investigation ?into potential Russian ties within the White House and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after potentially inappropriate conversations with the Kremlin. As many as three top officials of the Trump Administration have financial ties with Russia. There are swirling allegations that Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with Russia during his campaign.

""President Trump took aim at his predecessor?s environmental policies Tuesday, signing directives to advance two highly controversial proposed oil pipelines and to streamline regulatory review on infrastructure projects generally.
Trump also ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite approval of the Dakota Access pipeline, which would extend from the Dakotas to Illinois. That project has been vigorously opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is within a mile of the pipeline. The tribe has been worried about water contamination, and the corps recently had agreed to look to less intrusive alternatives""

cientific evidence for global warming is unequivocal.

t
hirty-one top scientific societies representing millions of scientists

In addition, the letter concluded that?""there is strong evidence that ongoing climate change is having broad negative impacts on society, including the global economy, natural resources and human health.""
I was deeply saddened to learn that you have already begun the?process of dismantling your predecessor's progress on environmental issues. Your alleged gag order on the EPA and fast tracking of approval for the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines demonstrates a?fundamental rejection of science.
I will be continuing to voice my concerns to my representatives on the environment and will work on discussing the issue with other Americans to ensure attention to this matter.

TRUMP'S FIRING COMEY SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I do not?support the President's decision to fire James Comey in the middle of an investigation. I think it has a chilling effect on the future of presidential oversight and is?frighteningly?reminiscent to Richard Nixon's Saturday Massacre.
I do not like the timing at all. It?occurred?almost?immediately after it was announced that a grand jury and?subpoenas were on the horizon. If it is shown that Sessions and Rosenstein cooked up a false reason to get?rid of Comey because the president was displeased with Comey's investigation,
this was nothing less than a baldfaced attempt to interfere with a legitimate investigation of the executive branch.
While the President has the?right to fire Comey, the circumstances might mean he has breached his oath in doing so. This reeks of a scheme to mislead the American people and prevent discovery of his possible misconduct violates his oath of office. If he is engaged in such conduct, he is no longer acting to enforce and execute the laws of the United States and Congress should take a closer look at impeachment.*

Now, the FBI has announced it has begun an investigation regarding conversations National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had with?Vladimir Putin.
There were also allegations that President Trump may have colluded with Russia during his campaign and these reports have been largely ignored by the Oversight Committee.
We believe Chairman Chaffetz has also failed to?adequately?review President Trump's?business conflicts of interest and potential collusion with Russia.
By not doing his job, Representative Chaffetz is delivering a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation. If he is?unwilling to look further into these pressing matters for political reasons, he should step aside.
HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am a concerned citizen. I am calling to ask that the committee chairman immediately express his intention to investigate the White House's Russian ties.
Last night, it was announced it has begun an investigation regarding conversations National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had with the Kremlin.
I feel the Oversight Committee has dropped the ball, failing to adequately review President Trump's business conflicts of interest and potential collusion with Russia. Now, with this revelation about Michael Flynn, now more than ever, we need government oversight.
If Representative Chaffetz refuses to open an investigation, he is delivering a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation. If he is unwilling to look further into these pressing matters for political reasons, he should step aside.

AS DISTRACTIONS FLOOD THE NEWS, WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION.
As Trump news swirls about anything and everything accept Russian collusion, it was finally confirmed that the FBI ""obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump, part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and the campaign, law enforcement and other U.S. officials said.""
""The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page?s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.""
""This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump?s favor.""

With the vote count looking uncertain at best, Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) now must decide whether to push forward with plans to vote on Thursday or put it off to allow more time for negotiations.
The White House stepped up its efforts to sway resistant lawmakers, including meetings with President Trump and other officials.
So far, however, those appeals appeared unable to sway enough votes for the bill to gain a majority. Assuming that all the chamber's Democratic members vote against the bill, Republicans can afford to lose 21 from their ranks.

HEALTH CARE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the Affordable Care Act and REJECT the plan to replace it.
Reapealing and Replacing"" ObamaCare is a playing politics with people's lives. What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws.
The GOP?s new plan would reduce the government?s role in helping people afford health insurance and would likely leave
[millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html)
without it. Between 6 million and 10 million people would lose coverage. The bill also places a
cap on Medicaid funding based on the number of enrollees. This will?effectively harm a program that over 17 million of our most vulnerable citizens rely on.
I am calling on you to reject this Health Bill and instead?focuses on positive changes to the existing law.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If my Representative supports this Health Care bill I will not be voting for them come reelection.

With words that can only be described as astounding, Attorney Jeff Sessions stated he would be open to appointing a Special Counsel...but not to investigate Trump:
(
[POLITICO](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/jeff-sessions-justice-department-probe-eric-holder-loretta-lynch-235862)
):
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday that he would be open to bringing in an outside counselor to investigate the practices of his Department of Justice predecessors under former President Barack Obama.
Sessions was asked about such an arrangement during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who suggested that Sessions might ask outside counsel to look into the department under Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.
'Well, I?m going to do everything I possibly can to restore the independence and professionalism of the Department of Justice,? Sessions replied. ?So we?ll have to consider whether or not some outside counsel is needed. Generally, a good review of that internally is the first step before any such decision is made.'""

Attorney General Sessions stated
in a recent interview
he would consider appointing a Special Counsel to review Obama's DOJ. Right now, we have more pressing issues. While AG Sessions should look into government misconduct, we need to start with the current Administration.
President Trump should testify under oath and explain what evidence he possesses regarding his claim that President Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower the 2016 campaign. He should also answer questions about possible Russian business ties and relevant communications between his staff and the Kremlin. Two-thirds of Americans want a Special Counsel appointed to?review these allegations and settle the matter once and for all. What are you waiting for?

WE TELL TRUMP: NO DAMN WALL.
WE DON'T NEED IT. WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.
""President Donald Trump wants everyone to know he is not backing down from the promise of forcing Mexico to pay for the border wall that was a big part of his campaign platform. But it seems he has now realized that getting another country to pay for something they decidedly don?t want is a bit complicated."" (

Trump assured his Supporters the wall would be paid for by Mexico...but not now.
?Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall"" Trump?wrote in a Tweet.
Trump must convince Congress to fund the wall which is no easy task: ""
Democrats hate it. Border-state Republicans don't like it. Congressional Republican leaders would rather not undertake it."" (

TRUMP'S WALL SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I know the Congressional Budget will be voted on soon and I would like my representative to vote against any funding for an?unnecessary?border wall.
Recently, the?Trump Administration has threatened Democrats that unless they support Congressional funding for Trump's Wall, the White House will cease making subsidy payments to bring the Affordable Care Act?crashing down.
Using the lives of millions of people who rely on healthcare to serve as a gambling chip for a wall we don't need is bad policy.
Frankly, the wall is too expensive and we don't need it. A study?published by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that any success the Trump administration has in reducing the U.S.'s undocumented Mexican labor force won?t actually lead to more jobs or higher wages for U.S. workers.*?There are countless more meaningful ways that money can be spent to help our country. I will not support my Representative come the next election unless they stand up against this wasteful and empty symbol.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today to make sure the investigation into potential Russian ties with the Trump Administration is made the full priority of Congress until it is resolved.
I am also calling on my representative to support an independent counsel to look into this matter.
Congress should act as if?business is usual before we find out the truth.
On March 20, the FBI confirmed that an ongoing investigation has been taking place. Since then, the GOP has failed us by refusing to appoint an Independent Counsel. After the ridiculous Nunes spectacle, and now his recusal, I want to make sure?stepping aside?doesn't mean tabling the investigation. Every day that passes, we hear more and more troubling pieces of information, including news that Betsy DeVos' brother, Erik Prince, may have had a secret meeting with Putin officials on?behalf of Donald Trump.

AS 45TH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS SWORN INTO POWER, WE THE PEOPLE VOW TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY.
Budowsky: Trump versus a free press
By Brent Budowsky - 01/18/17
(THE HILL)
""America has come a long way from the inaugurations of George Washington, who warned of the danger of our democracy being corrupted by foreign interests, and Thomas Jefferson, who warned of the danger from those who would attack and undermine our free press.""
""Today large numbers of Americans are disapproving and fearful about the consequences of inaugurating Donald Trump?as our next president. They deplore his contempt for core notions of our democracy, his praise for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and other dictators who would destroy democracy, and his intolerance, contempt and threats against Americans who disagree with him. They abhor his demeaning of large segments of the diverse American family, his claim that the alliance that defends democracy is obsolete, his relative lack of interest in receiving intelligence briefings to learn facts about global security, his comparison of our intelligence services to Nazi Germany, and his disrespect for the views of every intelligence service and future members of his Cabinet who warn against Russian attacks against democracy in America and Europe.""
""While Jefferson brilliantly argued that a free press is a vital guarantor of all other freedoms, Trump like Putin treats the free press with scorn, derision and contempt. Jefferson was right and Trump is wrong. The free press is not an enemy of the state that should be delegitimized and destroyed. It is the essential ingredient to inform the citizens of free nations.""
...
""Perhaps Trump will abandon his war against a free press. If not, America will need our free press to rise to its finest hour.""
?
HOW TO USE YOUR VOICE:
As we move forward, let us be mindful of what is at stake. Let us guard our personal liberties; encourage a strong?press; protect our D
emocracy; and hope for decency as a nation.
America is a strong country. We will persevere.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat in Washington whose interactions with President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing, according to the Justice Department...

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I am calling today because enough is enough. The DOJ must announce that they have begun the process of appointing a Special Counsel to investigate the Trump Administration's Russian ties.
It appears that Attorney General Sessions misled the Congress under Oath when he stated he ""did not have communications with the Russians. Now, we know the Attorney General met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat - the same person whose interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing.
If these allegations are true, I believe Attorney General Sessions should resign for the good of the country. The Attorney General is responsible to uphold the truth. In that purpose, he has failed us.
?
While Attorney General Sessions claimed he planned on recusing himself from an investigation, I am growing weary at empty promises. The Department of Justice should appoint a Special Council today. It would be an unfathomable conflict of interest to have the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General oversee proceedings as political appointees. An independent investigation is absolutely necessary in this case and is long over due.

Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am calling because after a barrage of news reports that Donald Trump chose to share highly classified information with the Russians, it now appears the President attempted to interfere with an active FBI investigation by asking James Comey to drop it.
There are step the Congress can take to see to it the American people get the answers we deserve. First, Comey should testify before Congress and his notes should be turned over to the Judiciary Committee so we can know the full story. Second the time is now for an Independent Investigation or Special Prosecutor.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I do not agree with President Trump's?remarks that our country needs a shutdown.
We already know the cost that a government shutdown would bring. Last time, ""850,000 federal employees were put through a wrenching furlough and access to national parks and the Smithsonian was curtailed, with serious consequences for tourism across the country. All told, the economy lost $24 billion. That would be a costly mistake.
No president has ever called for anything so?irresponsible and I call on my representative to do everything in their power to avoid a shutdown this fall.

TRUMP'S HEALTH BILL IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.
IT MAKES AMERICA SICK AGAIN.
?(
[CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-health-care-bill-will-it-pass-the-whip-count/)
) ""
The first major legislative test of Donald Trump?s presidency is slated for Thursday night, when the House holds its highly anticipated vote on the Republican health care bill. There are no Democrats who are expected to support the bill, but it also has detractors within the GOP.""
""Some conservatives are rejecting the bill, which would replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), because it?s not a clean repeal of the ACA. The nicknames say it all -- ?Obamacare 2.0? and ?Obamacare Lite.? Moderates complain that moving up the timeline to roll back the ACA?s Medicaid expansion would leave too many without insurance. Many of the bill?s opponents also criticize it for not doing enough to control rising premium costs.""
?
""Republicans need 216 votes to win passage in the House. They can lose no more than 21. If they lose 22, there would likely be a 215 to 215 tie, which means the bill would fail.""
""Here?s CBS News? list of the House Republicans who at this moment say they cannot support the bill in its current form. It?s a list that?s subject to change, with a lot of arms to be twisted and horses to be traded in the next couple of days. We will be updating the regularly, if and when members decide on how they?re voting or change their minds.

HEALTH CARE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the Affordable Care Act and REJECT the plan to replace it.
Reapealing and Replacing"" ObamaCare is a playing politics with people's lives. What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws.
The GOP?s new plan would reduce the government?s role in helping people afford health insurance and would likely leave
[millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html)
without it. Between 6 million and 10 million people would lose coverage. The bill also places a
cap on Medicaid funding based on the number of enrollees. This will?effectively harm a program that over 17 million of our most vulnerable citizens rely on.
I am calling on you to reject this Health Bill and instead?focuses on positive changes to the existing law.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If my Representative supports this Health Care bill I will not be voting for them come reelection.

Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE].
I am calling because I feel the government is NOT doing enough to examine?Donald Trump's innumerable potential conflicts of interest.
I know that Director Shaub has been vocal about Donald Trump's need to divest his business and I wholeheartedly?support his efforts to provide independent oversight of the Trump Administration, particularly when Representative Chaffetz and the House Oversight Committee has refused to take on the very real danger of Trump's conflicts of interest.
Billionaire Donald Trump presents a unique?challenge to oversight as his business dealings spread across domestic and international spheres. It is?imperative an?inquiry is started immediately to ensure the integrity of our system.
I hope that Director Shaub stands up to any attempt to silence his efforts, and he remains vocal and louder than ever.

TRUMP TAXES SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I have grown frustrated with Congress' inaction when it comes to examining President Trump's tax returns. Yesterday, thousands of protesters marched in 200?cities across the U.S. - polls show that 74% of Americans believe Donald Trump?should release his tax returns. Why has Congress failed to make that happen?
According to experts there are a few ways Congress can examine the returns through legislation or with the power of oversight in various committees.
Billionaire Donald Trump has business dealings spread across domestic and international spheres. One of the strongest foundations of our country is the premise of government oversight and accountability to the public.
By not releasing his tax returns, the President is sending a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation. If my?representative?fails to step it up on this issue, I will not be supporting them come the next election.

SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I believe the government is not doing enough to examine the Trump Administration's connection with Russia.
I am calling on the Senate Intelligence Committee to begin an investigation ?into potential Russian ties within the White House and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.
?
I would like to express my support for Chairman Burr's apparent decision to pursue this matter. It has been announced that the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested that Russia-related materials from over a dozen agencies, organizations, and individuals preserved.There are many reasons why it's a good idea:
National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after potentially inappropriate conversations with the Kremlin. As many as three top officials of the Trump Administration have financial ties with Russia. There are swirling allegations that Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with Russia during his campaign.
I please ask the Committee take up the slack left by the inaction of the House Oversight Committee. The American public deserves the truth.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I am calling today because enough is enough. The DOJ must announce that they have begun the process of appointing a Special Counsel to investigate the Trump Administration's Russian ties.
It appears that Attorney General Sessions misled the Congress under Oath when he stated he ""did not have communications with the Russians. Now, we know the Attorney General met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat - the same person whose interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing.
If these allegations are true, I believe Attorney General Sessions should resign for the good of the country. The Attorney General is responsible to uphold the truth. In that purpose, he has failed us.
?
While Attorney General Sessions claimed he planned on recusing himself from an investigation, I am growing weary at empty promises. The Department of Justice should appoint a Special Council today. It would be an unfathomable conflict of interest to have the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General oversee proceedings as political appointees. An independent investigation is absolutely necessary in this case and is long over due.

According to the Guardian, a source indicated that the investigation has confirmed Trump's biggest fear, proof of Russian collusion.
""One source suggested the official [American] investigation was making progress. 'They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion,' the source said. 'This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [Russian] influence relating to the use of hacked material.'""?(

TRUMP INVESTIGATION SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I would like my Senator to please do everything to ensure the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election moves forward.
This week, there are a lot of distracting stories in the news, but one item should hold our attention.?It was finally confirmed.?According to U.S. officials, the FBI ""obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump.?The warrant targeted Carter Page?s communications after the government convinced a judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of Russia.
This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Please do everything in your office's power to get to the bottom of this situation.

Transgender students on Wednesday lost federal protections that allowed them to use school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identities, as the Trump administration stepped into a long-simmering national debate.
The administration came down on the side of states? rights, lifting Obama-era federal guidelines that had been characterized by Republicans as an example of overreach.
Without the Obama directive, it will be up to states and school districts to interpret federal anti-discrimination law and determine whether students should have access to restrooms in accordance with their expressed gender identity and not just their biological sex.""

TRANSGENDER STUDENTS SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I am reaching out to Governor [NAME HERE] to express my disagreement with the recent decision by the Trump Administration to rescind?protections set in place for transgender students.
I believe strongly that individuals should be able to use school bathrooms?that match their gender identity.
President Trump's withdrawal of the directive makes this a state's right issue - it shouldn't be one.
Instead, it is a human's rights issue.
?Nevertheless, I ask that you please urge our school districts to?adhere to the previously rescinded guidance.
As one of your peers, Governor Mark Dayton of Minnesota stated, (transgender students) ""are vulnerable people with very challenging life circumstances and they deserve our compassion and support, not our attacks and demonization.""

I am also calling on my representative to support an independent counsel to look into this matter.
Congress should act as if?business is usual before we find out the truth.
The FBI has confirmed that an ongoing investigation has been taking place. Since then, the GOP has failed us by refusing to appoint an Independent Counsel. Every day that passes, we hear more and more troubling pieces of information, including news that former

Bill. It simply does not go far enough to protect the most vulnerable Americans.
The American Health Care Act will probably result in 24 million more uninsured; higher deductibles; reduce the number of lower-income people with coverage; reduce the quality of insurance plans; increase costs for a substantial number of people who have preexisting conditions. It must change.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If my representative votes for this replacement without improvements, I will not be voting for them come the next election.

Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I am calling today because enough is enough. The DOJ must announce that they have begun the process of appointing a Special Counsel to investigate the Trump Administration's Russian ties.
It appears that Attorney General Sessions misled the Congress under Oath when he stated he ""did not have communications with the Russians. Now, we know the Attorney General met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat - the same person whose interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing.
If these allegations are true, I believe Attorney General Sessions should resign for the good of the country. The Attorney General is responsible to uphold the truth. In that purpose, he has failed us.
?
While Attorney General Sessions claimed he planned on recusing himself from an investigation, I am growing weary at empty promises. The Department of Justice should appoint a Special Council today. It would be an unfathomable conflict of interest to have the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General oversee proceedings as political appointees. An independent investigation is absolutely necessary in this case and is long over due.

Evoking?the nuclear option for Supreme Court justices throws out hundred year old precedent and promises that extreme appointees have an easier time to the bench.
Senator John McCain called such an action stupid. Mitch McConnell himself, in 2013 said breaking the rules to change the rules was un-American. I agree with them.
?I believe the GOP has set this country on a dangerous path: where rules don't matter, where investigations can be tainted and purposely stonewalled, and our values are laid by the waste-side for partisan politics.

We continue our week's mission to push the DOJ toward an independent investigation. The?only chance at a fair and balance investigation into the Trump Administration's alleged Russian ties is to take it out of the hands of the Republicans in the House and Senate and have Jeff Sessions recuse himself.
We?request that a Special Prosecutor be appointed immediately.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I believe the government is not doing enough to examine the Trump Administration's connection with Russia.
I am calling on the Department of Justice to appoint a Special Prosecutor to begin an investigation into potential Russian ties within the White House and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.
?
I believe it would be a conflict of interest to have the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to oversee proceedings as political appointees. An independent Special Prosecutor is appropriate in this case.
It is the Justice Department's job to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States.?The American public deserves the truth.

TRUMP'S PERSONAL COST TO TAXPAYERS IS OUT OF CONTROL.
IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO PAY UP.
(
[Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290162)
) ""According to a recent
[investigation by the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-familys-elaborate-lifestyle-a-logistical-nightmare--at-taxpayer-expense/2017/02/16/763cce8e-f2ce-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html?utm_term=.357e816540ac)
, President Trump?s first three trips to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach have cost the federal treasury -- American taxpayers -- as much as $10 million within just the first month of his presidency. By the end of his term, that number could total hundreds of millions of dollars.""
On a related note, the city of New York pays roughly $500,000 per day securing Trump Tower, where First Lady Melania Trump and son Barron are currently living. The annual cost could end up being around $183 million for this alone.
Meanwhile, Trump has put forth one of the stingiest budget proposals: ""
Trump's budget would cut off funding entirely for several agencies, including arts, public broadcasting and development groups, and also proposes steep cuts to agencies like the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency."" (

TRUMP BUDGET SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because President Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago are costing us millions of dollars while his budget will hurt Americans.
I am calling on you to 1) reject his budget and 2) demand the president reign in his travel spending.
Now more than ever, we need legislation that puts a cap on this spending, or, he needs to pay up
.
The president's trips to Mar-A-Lago are costing a fortune. To make matters?worse, security for his Manhattan residence can end up costing the government $183 million a year alone.
At the same time, President Trump?s proposed budget blueprint eliminates funding for important government programs.
I?believe strongly in the arts - so many of our nation's children have grown up watching programs like Sesame Street. These cuts ignore the fabric of what we represent. Cuts to the EPA and Education should also be rejected. Thank you.

TAKE YOUR CONCERNS ONLINE!
[EMAIL THE WHITE HOUSE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/)
WARNING! MAKE SURE TO UNCHECK THE BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE COMMENT SITE
Now that the Trump Administration has suspended the White House longstanding comment line - they are instead encouraging you to send an email. At the very bottom, you may unwittingly be signing up for their newsletter unless you clear the box. Very unsettling!!!
You can also send letters to the White House here:
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500
NOTE: we have found that the White House comment line, 202-456-1111, an important buffer between the people and the president, IS NOT FUNCTIONING.
Every day, we need to also tell the Trump White House to open this line NOW!
LET'S ALSO CONTACT OUR SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES AND LET THEM KNOW WE WANT AMERICA TO REVERSE COURSE ON REFUGEES AND WANT OVERSIGHT OF DONALD TRUMP'S CONFLICT'S OF INTEREST!

[Find your representatives](http://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep)
It has been confirmed by congressional aides that a planned visit to a representative's District Office is the most effective means of advocacy, followed by calling the District Office to express concerns. Once you find your Representative, locate their District Office for maximum effect!
SCRIPT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
Dear President Trump,
I am one of the many Americans who believes strongly that your current policy that indefinitely bans Syrian refugees from entering the country is inconsistent with who we are as a nation.
While you?signed?your Executive Order, you stated that it was ""to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States.""
This statement misconstrues the facts.
L
ethal acts of jihadist terrorism in the States since 9/11 have been carried out by American citizens or legal residents, and
none of them have been the work of Syrian refugees or people from the countries listed in the travel ban.
Not only are these Syrian refugees not terrorists, but they are fleeing the brutal state terrorism of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and the brutal non-state terrorism of ISIS.?The refugees are the victims of terrorism, not the perpetrators of terrorism.
The United States has taken only around 15,000 Syrian refugees, amounting to a tiny 0.2% of the total number of refugees, the large majority of whom are women and children.
Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe do not go through anything like the rigorous process experienced by those who are coming to the States, and the volume of Syrians fleeing to Europe is orders of magnitude larger than it is to the United States.
The promise of the United States written on the Statue of Liberty is from the Emma Lazarus poem: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Please do your part in ensuring the United States remains the beacon of hope it is in the world.
I will be continuing to voice my concerns on this issue and will work on discussing these issues with other constituents to ensure attention to this matter.

While the War Powers Act provides the president with the opportunity to?respond with the?military in?emergencies without seeking prior congressional approval, it is unclear if?these activities qualify. Sustained military campaigns, whether the objective is defeating ISIS etc, require timely and specific congressional approval.
?Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi called on Speaker Ryan to call Congress back in session for classified briefings and debate on Trump's recent military actions, I think that is a good idea.

[refusal to release his own tax returns](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/democrats-see-opening-in-tax-overhaul-fight-trumps-own-deductions.html)
is emerging as a central hurdle to another faltering campaign promise.
As procrastinators rushed to file their tax returns by Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, emphasized again on Monday that Mr. Trump had no intention of making his public. Democrats have seized on that decision, uniting around a pledge not to cooperate on any rewriting of the tax code unless they know specifically how that revision would benefit the billionaire president and his family.
And a growing roster of more than a dozen Republican lawmakers now say Mr. Trump should release them.""

TRUMP TAXES SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I have grown frustrated with Congress' inaction when it comes to examining President Trump's tax returns.
?
It is no secret that Congress wishes to pass sweeping tax reform. I strongly believe that no tax plan should be passed unless we know exactly how it impacts the President and his family.
?
According to experts there are a few ways Congress can examine the returns through legislation or with the power of oversight in various committees.
Billionaire Donald Trump has business dealings spread across domestic and international spheres. One of the strongest foundations of our country is the premise of government oversight and accountability to the public.
By not releasing his tax returns, the President is sending a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation.",2017-06-06 21:04:14.777370,,,"THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO TRUMP'S TAXES: TELL CONGRESS, NO TAX REFORM UNLESS WE SEE THEM.",Parsed www.calltoactivism.com for training data,,[],calltoactivism.com,[],[],http://www.calltoactivism.com/4182017---theres-another-way-to-trumps-taxes-tell-congress-no-tax-reform-unless-we-see-them.html

?
Senator Jeff Sessions is simply unfit to serve as our Attorney General. His record makes the defense of Civil Rights and the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws a dismal proposition:

Trump?s pick has drawn widespread outrage because of Sessions?s opposition to the Voting Rights Act, support for anti-immigration legislation and history of making racist comments.""

NUNES IS THERE FOR TRUMP. HE HAS TO GO.
HOW MANY REPUBLICANS DOES IT TAKE TO SCREW UP AN INVESTIGATION?
[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nunes-white-house-source-surveillance_us_58d92967e4b02a2eaab61087)
: ""
WASHINGTON ? House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) met a source on White House grounds last week, one day before he alleged that President
[Donald Trump](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump)
and his team were subjected to surveillance during the final months of the Obama administration.
Nunes met the source on White House grounds in order to view sensitive information in a ?secure location,? Jack Langer, Nunes? communications director, said Monday in a statement,
[CNN first reported](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/27/politics/devin-nunes-white-house-donald-trump/index.html)
.
Langer did not respond to a question about why Nunes and his source, who the chairman wouldn?t identify, did not use a sensitive compartmented information facility ? known as a SCIF ? on Capitol Hill instead.
Only individuals with specific approval can enter White House grounds.
The revelation about Nunes adds to speculation that he coordinated with Trump?s team before making allegations about the previous administration?s information-gathering.""

DEVIN NUNES SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to call on my Representative to do everything in their power to have Devin Nunes removed from his committee's
inquiry?into
Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and whether Donald Trump?s campaign colluded with, or was somehow compromised by, the Russians.
Representative Nunes acted?inappropriately when he rushed to the White House to brief the president, the very subject of his investigation, to share intelligence he discovered before sharing it with his committee. Today it was revealed he met his source at the White House, leading to questions whether he coordinated with Trump's team.
It is crucial that Congress provide an honest, credible examination into the Russian connection. Nunes? bad instincts have undermined public confidence that his panel can conduct such an inquiry.

We are?calling on the committee chairman agree to look into recent allegations that?President Trump's National Security?Advisor may have spoke about sanctions with Vladimir Putin before the election.
I am aware Chairperson Chaffetz has recommended an ethics review into Kelly Anne Conway's promotion of Ivanka Trump's clothing line from the White House?briefing room. But we need to go even further.
Now, the FBI has announced it has begun an investigation regarding conversations National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had with?Vladimir Putin.
There were also allegations that President Trump may have colluded with Russia during his campaign and these reports have been largely ignored by the Oversight Committee.
We believe Chairman Chaffetz has also failed to?adequately?review President Trump's?business conflicts of interest and potential collusion with Russia.
By not doing his job, Representative Chaffetz is delivering a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation. If he is?unwilling to look further into these pressing matters for political reasons, he should step aside.

Though the White House initially denied reports, Trump has confirmed he shared the intel for ""humanitarian"" reasons in a series of Tweets.

that our allies and partners must have the utmost confidence that sensitive information they share with us will not be disclosed, and I agree.

SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I believe the government is not doing enough to examine the Trump Administration's connection with Russia.
I am calling on the Senate Intelligence Committee to begin an investigation ?into potential Russian ties within the White House and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.
?
I would like to express my support for Chairman Burr's apparent decision to pursue this matter. It has been announced that the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested that Russia-related materials from over a dozen agencies, organizations, and individuals preserved.There are many reasons why it's a good idea:
National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after potentially inappropriate conversations with the Kremlin. As many as three top officials of the Trump Administration have financial ties with Russia. There are swirling allegations that Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with Russia during his campaign.
I please ask the Committee take up the slack left by the inaction of the House Oversight Committee. The American public deserves the truth.

SCRIPT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
Dear President Trump,
I am one of the many Americans who believes strongly that your Travel Ban and ?indefinite rejection of Syrian refugees from entering the country is inconsistent with who we are as a nation.
As a result of your Executive Order, hundreds of people from the seven countries that were specified were stranded in airports and unable to enter the country. This group ranged from people who have lived in America legally for years and were merely taking a vacation overseas, and those visiting their families.
Yesterday evening, thousands of citizens protested across our nation's airports in response to these travelers being detained at the airports and?to deliver the?unequivocal message that we will not stand for such overly broad and?prejudicial action.
While you?signed?your Executive Order, you stated that it was ""to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States.""
This statement misconstrues the facts.
L
ethal acts of jihadist terrorism in the States since 9/11 have been carried out by American citizens or legal residents, and
none of them have been the work of Syrian refugees or people from the countries listed in the travel ban.
Not only are these Syrian refugees not terrorists, but they are fleeing the brutal state terrorism of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and the brutal non-state terrorism of ISIS.?The refugees are the victims of terrorism, not the perpetrators of terrorism.
The United States has taken only around 15,000 Syrian refugees, amounting to a tiny 0.2% of the total number of refugees, the large majority of whom are women and children.
Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe do not go through anything like the rigorous process experienced by those who are coming to the States, and the volume of Syrians fleeing to Europe is orders of magnitude larger than it is to the United States.
The promise of the United States written on the Statue of Liberty is from the Emma Lazarus poem: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Please do your part in ensuring the United States remains the beacon of hope it is in the world.
I will be continuing to voice my concerns on this issue and will work on discussing these issues with other constituents to ensure attention to this matter.

Now that the Trump Administration has suspended the White House longstanding comment line - they are instead encouraging you to send an email. At the very bottom, you may unwittingly be signing up for their newsletter unless you clear the box. Very unsettling!!!
You can also send letters to the White House here:

SCRIPT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
Dear President Trump,
Despite your recent claim that the country does not care?whether you release your tax returns, a recent
ABC News/
Washington Post
poll?concluded that 74% of Americans?believe you should.
One of the strongest foundations of our country is the premise of government?oversight and accountability to the public. By not releasing your tax returns, you are sending a message that you believe you do not owe such responsibility to the nation.
Please make an unequivocal promise that you will release your tax returns when the IRS concludes its audit.
SCRIPT FOR YOUR SENATOR
Dear Senator (Senator's name here),
It has come to my attention that Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden has introduced?legislation that will ensure President Trump complies with requests to release his tax?return. I am expressing my support for this bill and hope you would please lend your vote when it comes up for consideration.
As a recent

poll demonstrates, 74% of Americans?believe the President?should comply with this request by the media and our citizens.
One of the strongest foundations of our country is the premise of government?oversight and accountability to the public.

SCRIPT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE COMMENT LINE
Dear President Trump,
I am writing because today because I attempted to call the longstanding White House comment line at 202-456-1111 and was troubled when a message stated the comment line is currently closed.
While I plan to contact the White House through the online form, I would like to urge your administration to bring back the comment line's functionality as soon as possible. It is crucial for the People to have unimpeded access to express?our concerns to the White House and an online form may be?prohibitive to those without online access.",2017-06-06 21:04:20.855142,,,"DESPITE PRESIDENT'S CLAIMS, 74% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE TRUMP SHOULD RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.

AGAINST TRUMP!
MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP TREATS THE PRESS CORPS!
?
This past Wednesday, during his first press conference in the new year, President-Elect Trump ripped into CNN for running a story about a CIA briefing delivered to Trump that revealed serious allegations involving Russia.
At the center of the cross hairs was CNN's Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta who was shunned at the press conference and was denied a question after CNN was named along with Buzzfeed as an instigator of the ""fake news"" by Trump. The problem is Trump's assertions about CNN are exaggerated and false.
Unlike Buzzfeed who posted the entire 35-page elicit document, CNN merely mentioned the documents existence.
Since the press conference, journalists have signaled solidarity. Fox News'?Shepherd?Smith defended CNN, and explained that the?network followed reasonable journalistic standards in their coverage of the story.
President-Elect Trump's tactic to?vilify?the press when reporters engage in any negative story about him?delegitimizes the press and creates an smokey haze over their oversight of his presidency.

MEDICAID CUTS IN GOP HEALTH BILL COULD HARM THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED
BUT YOU PAY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO PLAY GOLF.
?
(The Sacramento Bee) ""Vital health care services for more than 17 million of the nation?s most vulnerable citizens could be on the chopping block if the Republican health care bill becomes law.
If Medicaid home and community-based services are cut for children with special needs and adults and seniors with disabilities, many would either end up in costly nursing homes, require more assistance from struggling family members or simply do without the care that allows them to live independently.
Medicaid, the state-national health care plan for poor people and those with disabilities, is the largest public provider of these non-medical services, covering 30 percent of working-age adults with disabilities like cerebral palsy, mental illness, and traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries.""
""The GOP bill moves Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement program to one with capped funding based on the number of enrollees.""
""Patient advocates fear that states will trim those optional Medicaid services if the program faces the 10-year,
[$880 billion cut in federal funding that the GOP health care bill proposes](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article138249963.html)

""That ?per capita? funding formula wouldn?t keep pace with Medicaid?s current spending growth, leaving states to either make up the funding shortfall or
cut costs by limiting enrollment, cutting services or lowering payments to Medicaid providers

MEDICAID SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I oppose the new Health Care bills' cap on Medicaid funding based on the number of enrollees. This bill will force the burden on states who will have the option to cover the shortfall or limit services and cut enrollees. This will?effectively harm a program that over 17 million of our most vulnerable citizens rely on.
I am calling on you to reject this Health Bill and instead?focuses on positive changes to the existing law.
Medicaid is the largest public provider of non-medical services like home care, covering 30 percent of working-age adults with disabilities like cerebral palsy, mental illness, and traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries.
Our country has always been a beacon of compassion and decency. These cuts represent neither. I will be keeping an eye on this issue, and if my Representative does not vote against this Health Care bill, I will not be supporting them?when they face?reelection.

""House Republicans boast that their health care bill would reduce average premiums, but that's because the insurance policies will generally cover less. It?would mean those who actually use the coverage will pay more to get treatment. Those additional out-of-pocket costs could total thousands of dollars more, in some cases, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill.""
""Obamacare put in place an array of protections that pushed up premiums, but shielded Americans from big health care bills. It required insurers to sell comprehensive policies that cover 10 essential health benefits, including hospitalization, prescription drugs, mental health and maternity care. It mandated carriers shoulder a certain share of the costs of covered benefits.?The GOP's American Health Care Act would weaken many of those provisions."" (

Fourth, many experts have even claimed such a ban as ineffective for its intended purpose.
There are also claim that the Executive Order will?prioritize?refugees for religious persecution ... ""provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual?s country of nationality.?

SCRIPT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE COMMENT LINE
Dear President Trump,
I am writing because today because I attempted to call the longstanding White House comment line at 202-456-1111 and was troubled when a message stated the comment line is currently closed.
While I plan to contact the White House through the online form, I would like to urge your administration to bring back the comment line's functionality as soon as possible. It is crucial for the People to have unimpeded access to express?our concerns to the White House and an online form may be?prohibitive to those without online access.",2017-06-06 21:04:40.161296,,,"DONALD TRUMP DECLARES WAR ON MUSLIMS, PLANS TO FULFILL CAMPAIGN PROMISE OF INDEFINITE BAN.",Parsed www.calltoactivism.com for training data,,[],calltoactivism.com,[],[],http://www.calltoactivism.com/1262017---donald-trump-declares-war-on-muslims-plans-to-fulfill-campaign-promise-of-indefinite-ban.html

?DOCUMENTS ALLEGEDLY CONFIRM TRUMP STILL BENEFITING FROM HIS BUSINESS.
""
Before taking office, President Trump promised to place his assets in a trust designed to erect a wall between him and the businesses that made him wealthy.
But newly released?documents show that Trump himself is the sole beneficiary of the trust and that it is legally controlled by his oldest son and a longtime employee.
?
The documents, obtained through a public records request by the investigative news service ProPublica and
[first reported by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)
, also show that Trump retains the legal power to revoke the trust at any time.
...
While Trump has promised he will observe a separation between his business and the presidency,
he retains ownership of the business and will personally benefit if the business profits from decisions made by his government
.
Further, the business will be run by family members who remain the most trusted members of Trump?s inner circle, raising questions about whether Trump?s promises to limit communication about the business?s fate are realistic.""
...
Congressional Democrats, including Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), have been pressing the GSA to conclude that the Trump Organization is out of compliance with the lease.
?This legal concoction from President Trump?s lawyers does nothing to address his conflicts of interest or the breach of the lease for his hotel,? Cummings said in a statement

OBAMACARE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling to add my name to the sea of voices in our state who support the Affordable Care Act and REJECT the plan to replace it.
""Reapealing and Replacing"" ObamaCare is a playing politics with people's lives. What we need is an honest and fair improvement of the current laws.
The GOP?s new plan would reduce the government?s role in helping people afford health insurance and would likely leave
[millions of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html)
without it. Between 6 million and 10 million people would lose coverage, according to
[initial estimates](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/7/14844446/standard-poors-sp-ahca-obamacare-repeal-replace)
by Standard & Poor?s.
I care deeply about this issue, and many Americans' health and lives are at stake. If you vote for a repeal to ObamaCare without an immediate replacement, I will not be voting for you come the next election.

As Representative Issa, a Republican, stated Friday night, it would be a conflict of interest to have the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to oversee proceedings as?political appointees. I agree with Rep. Issa that a Special Prosecutor would be appropriate in this case.
It is the Justice Department's job to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States.?The American public deserves the truth.

TRUMPS PLAN TO DEFUND THE NIH COULD SET US BACK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
THE PURPOSE OF THE NIH IS TO INCREASE OUR LIFESPANS. TELL CONGRESS, HANDS OFF!
On Tuesday, the Trump Administration expressed it's desire to cut funding to the National Institutes of Health by 1.2 billion dollars.
Under the umbrella of the NIH is the National Institute on Aging. ""Research on Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) is an important component of the NIA?s mission. In recent years, Congress has provided a significant amount of additional funding beyond our typical appropriation for us to accelerate research on the basic biology, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care related to this devastating group of diseases.""

NIH SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling on my representative to REJECT any attempts to cut funding to the NIH. The Trump Administration has indicated it will recommend a cut of 1.2 billion dollars, or 20% of the NIH's budget.
Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, Americans today are living longer and healthier. Life expectancy in the United States has jumped from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years as reported in 2009, and disability in people over age 65 has dropped dramatically in the past 3 decades. In recent years, nationwide rates of new diagnoses and deaths from all cancers combined have fallen significantly.
The NIA, under the umbrella of the NIH is fighting for a cure to Alzheimers. Please do not set our country back on medical research when our future relies on it.

'The Federal Government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results,' the draft of the budget says.
A representative for Meals on Wheels said not enough details were provided to discern how this budget would impact the program, but that 'it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which they will not be significantly and negatively impacted.'""
Conservatives countered the cuts would ""only"" amount to 3.3%, of Meals on Wheels' budget, but Trump's budgets ignore important government programs - and we won't let that happen.

I?believe strongly in the arts - so many of our nation's children have grown up watching programs like Sesame Street. These cuts ignore the fabric of what we represent.

DONALD TRUMP'S TRIP SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am calling because I am have grave concerns with the timing of Donald Trump's planned international trip this Friday. President Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi?rabia, Israel and the West Bank, and the Vatican, followed by attendance at meetings of NATO in Brussels and the G7?alliance in Sicily.
While the president obviously has great?latitude to represent us globally and visit foreign heads of state, I worry that he does not appreciate the gravity of his choice to
share highly classified information with the Russians. His loose lips may have endangered the life of an?intelligence source and that person's family.?it also is damaging our crucial intelligence-sharing relationships with allies.
It is hard to imagine Trump?exercising?sufficient self-control to emerge from this eight day?trip?without incident. I feel Congress can launch hearings into ways the President and his Administration handle classified information, and perhaps they need further briefings on what not to say during these international trips.

WE ARE HAMMERING THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. WILL YOU HELP US?
The Senate Intelligence Committee has heard the calls of people like us and has begun its investigation into Trump's alleged Russia connections and their involvement in the 2016 election. The investigation is in its early stages, as evidence is being gathered.
As things progress, we need to make it clear that We the People have a few ideas about how this investigation should proceed (read more

SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is [NAME HERE] and I am a concerned U.S. citizen from [YOUR STATE]. I have learned that because people like me have remained steadfast, the Intelligence Committee has?announced its intention to investigate Russian involvement in the 2016 election, as well as potential Russian ties with the Trump administration.
I am calling because while I know this process is in the earliest stages, and it will be long and drawn out, the American people deserve the following:
1)
We deserve a fair and transparent process
. While classified evidence may be the subject of scrutiny, the American people deserve for as much information as possible to be released.
?2) We must be assured that
the Republicans will not?put party over truth
. If the Committee uncovers evidence that is detrimental to the president, it will?become a test for Republican members to release that information.
I implore the committee to be impartial
.
3) Michael Flynn, and other Trump associates?must be called in to testify under oath. No investigation will be complete unless all information is considered.
Thank you.

TRUMP'S LIES SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am calling today because I find the President's lack of?commitment to the truth to be harmful for our country. Whether it is making up untrue claims about his?predecessor wiretapping Trump Tower, or refuting photographic evidence, enough is enough.
?I?believe?it is time we hold our leaders accountable. If we don't stand up now, the integrity and credibility our government is in jeopardy.
There are things Congress can do to stop these alternative facts from becoming a reality. Congress can lean on the president with the power of floor?remarks, or if it becomes necessary, public censure of the President.
Please stand up for the truth.

When Attorney General Sessions allegedly violated his own promise to recuse himself from the investigation by participating in Comey's firing, it became clear the aims do not involve learning the truth.

OUR LETTER
This letter is sent on behalf of concerned citizens who believe our government is not doing enough to examine the Trump?administration's relationship with Russia and how it affects National Security.
We are?calling on the committee chairman agree to look into recent allegations that?President Trump's National Security?Advisor may have spoke about sanctions with Vladimir Putin before the election.
I am aware Chairperson Chaffetz has recommended an ethics review into Kelly Anne Conway's promotion of Ivanka Trump's clothing line from the White House?briefing room. But we need to go even further.
Now, the FBI has announced it has begun an investigation regarding conversations National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had with?Vladimir Putin.
There were also allegations that President Trump may have colluded with Russia during his campaign and these reports have been largely ignored by the Oversight Committee.
We believe Chairman Chaffetz has also failed to?adequately?review President Trump's?business conflicts of interest and potential collusion with Russia.
By not doing his job, Representative Chaffetz is delivering a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation. If he is?unwilling to look further into these pressing matters for political reasons, he should step aside.
HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SCRIPT
Hello, my name is (YOUR NAME) and I am a concerned citizen. I am troubled by the?recent news that there may be ties to the Kremlin and the Trump Administration. I am calling to ask that the committee chairman immediately express his intention to investigate the White House's Russian ties.
After a dossier that surfaced alleging collusion and as many as three top?officials of the Trump Administration having financial ties with Russia, the lack of action by Republicans is disheartening and frankly frightening.
?
In addition, I feel the Oversight Committee has dropped the ball, failing to adequately review President Trump's business conflicts of interest and potential collusion with Russia. Now, with this revelation about Michael Flynn, now more than ever, we need government oversight.
If Representative Chaffetz refuses to open an investigation, he is delivering a message that he believes he does not owe such responsibility to the nation.
