,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
We have a
[special prosecutor, Robert Mueller to investigate possible collusion](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/17/who-robert-mueller-new-special-counsel-leading-rus/)
between the Trump camp and Russia, one everyone agrees is the best possible choice. Hallelujah. Thanks to Rod Rosenstein who opted to take this step, wisely opting
[not to consult with the White House or Jeff Sessions on it?first](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-former-fbi-director-robert-mueller-1495058507-htmlstory.html)
.
We got here in part because Rod Rosenstein did absolutely the wise and right thing, of course.?But also because you called on your congresspeople:
to keep their eyes on Flynn;
to question apparent ties to Russia;
to get Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from anything related to Russia;
to question the timing of Comey's firing;
and now, to call for a special prosecutor.
Good job!
...so let's keep going
As MN Senator Amy Klobuchar said
[this morning on Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/2017/05/18/528900007/sen-amy-klobuchar-on-what-she-wants-to-hear-from-rosenstein)
, the special counsel is great and needed, but Robert Mueller's role is to answer one specific question: Did Trump actually collude with Russia to throw the election? In other words, everyone knows Russia meddled, but what is not known is the extent to which Trump knowingly participated.
Regardless of Mueller's?findings, there are other, different steps that need to be taken to safeguard?against this situation in the future. We need laws and?protocols?to protect?campaigns against this kind of information, as well as?to guide campaigns and media on how to treat leaked/hacked?information when presented with it. We need, Klobuchar and others suggest, an independent 9/11-style commission, which will be able to provide recommendations to that end.
Your task
Check
[this article](https://news.vice.com/story/here-are-all-the-members-of-congress-calling-for-an-independent-investigation-after-comeys-abrupt-dismissal)
to see whether your Senator previously called for a special prosecutor or not (quickest way is to search your state or your Senator's name). Call
[your Senator](http://govtrack.us)
.
If your Senator DID call for a special prosecutor:
My name is _____ and I live in ____. I am calling to thank Senator ____?for calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate possible collusion between the Trump camp and Russia.?Rod Rosenstein did the best thing he could have done by appointing Robert Mueller to be special prosecutor.
I am also calling to ask Senator ____ to call for a special commission to investigate the issue of foreign interference in our elections.?Regardless of whether President Trump had a role in the interference, everyone agrees the interference was there and?plagued?our elections. A special commission can?come up with recommendations for?laws and protocols to protect campaigns from foreign interference and stop them from using ill-gotten information against each other. Can I count on Senator ______ to support a special commission to investigate what happened in order to guard against similar situations in the future?
If your Senator did NOT call for a special prosecutor:
My name is _____ and I live in ____. I am calling to say Rod Rosenstein did absolutely the best thing he could have done by appointing Robert Mueller to be special prosecutor to investigate possible collusion between the Trump camp and Russia. This move?is being praised by Congresspeople?of both parties.?Can you tell me why Senator ______ did not support the appointment of a special prosecutor before?
[Wait for answer.]
The appointment?fosters bipartisanship, reestablishes trust, and frees up a whole lot of energy and attention for Congress and or the American people. If there was no collusion, great. Now we can know for sure. I am disappointed that Senator ______ did not have the courage to call for a special prosecutor before.
I am calling for a related reason as well. Regardless of whether President Trump had a role in the interference, everyone agrees there definitely
was
foreign interference in our elections. I am therefore asking Senator ____ to call for a special commission to investigate this issue. A special commission ?can come up with recommendations for laws and protocols to protect campaigns from foreign interference and stop them from using ill-gotten?information against each other. A responsible investigation to help us make our elections secure will help every American, Republicans and Democrats alike. Can I count on Senator ______ to support a special commission to investigate what happened in order to guard against similar situations in the future?

,"Hello!
It's working...
Trump is
[certainly taking heat](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/white-house-staff.html)
, but it's really Trump who brought this on himself.?But the strong attention being paid by people like you has helped generate the press's responsiveness and the congressional democrats' spine.
...so let's keep going
It's important not to get sucked into wish fulfillment fantasies. With this Congress and with
[Trump's core supporters still strongly behind him](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-republicans-dilemma-20170516-story.html)
, it's not likely Trump will be impeached and even less likely he'll be removed. It's true that
[this morning Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, subpoenaed the Comey memos](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/trump-comey-and-russia-how-key-washington-players-are-reacting/jason-chaffetz-lets-see-how-real-these-memos-are/)
describing Trump's attempts to influence him, but I have complete confidence that Chaffetz will use his committee's power to try to neutralize Trump's actions, not bring them to accountability.
Meanwhile, right-wing policies are getting passed even as this summer blockbuster unfolds. Let's address one of those today?an attempt to open up our protected public lands to drilling and other industry.
Today's action is inspired by
[My Civic Workout](http://mailchi.mp/mycivicworkout/lean-green-resisting-machine-233891?e=732111aa91)
. They're awesome. Their words: ""The administration is 'reviewing the status' of 27 public lands designated as national monuments: this is their euphemism for seeking to allow drilling and other destructive activities on some of America?s most beautiful wild lands. These monuments also protect wildlife and support the economies of nearby towns by bringing in tourists. The administration is trying to shut out the public by having an absurdly short notice and comment period?only 15 days."" Read more about the Antiquities Act, the economic and cultural importance of national monuments, and the harm that will be done of this historic rollback
[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/climate/antiquities-act-federal-lands-donald-trump.html)
.
Your task
Post a comment TODAY, as there is a very short comment period.
[Here](http://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=DOI-2017-0002-0001)
is the link to the site.
Take a look at the monuments currently being targeted
[here](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-0001)
. Take a look at the rest of the monuments in the U.S.
[here](https://www.nps.gov/archeology/sites/antiquities/monumentslist.htm)
. Take a look at your state's protected areas
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Protected_areas_of_the_United_States_by_state)
. ?Don't forget to consider nearby states; for example, Chicago, my place of residence, is just a few hours from incredible beauty in Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan.
Again,
[here](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=DOI-2017-0002-0001)
is the comment site where you will post your comment.
Write of course whatever you like. Here are some ideas:
[Either]
I grew up around/I live near/I frequently visit ______. Because of this monument, I [learned to appreciate the beauty around us; experienced incredible family bonding time that lasts to this day; was inspired to follow my career of ____; learned to hunt and fish/hike and camp/bird and botanize, activities I cherish]. [____ has vilatized the areas nearby fostering small businesses and providing jobs a the monument itself.]
OR
I often frequent [such and such publicly protected place], a place similar to the national monuments under review, and similarly protected. I understand the value of natural areas on the mind, body and soul.
[Appreciating quiet and beauty; experiencing family bonding by doing ___ with my ___; exploring the mysteries of ____; learning to hunt and fish/hike and camp/bird and botanize, activities I cherish] has been an essential part of my/my family's experience.
[Then in either case add]
It is simply not up to us to use up everything around us. The world is moving forward with new kinds of industry and energy policy, and if we open up our monuments to development today, we leave nothing for our children, or for other creatures in the world, tomorrow. States do not have the capacity to protect and manage lands on their own. Considering a change in status of these monuments is tragically short-sighted. I implore you to retain the protection of ____, other national monuments, and other public protected lands.
[Consider incorporating some of all of a
[Teddy Roosevelt quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt)
:]
""I ask nothing of the nation except that it so behave as each farmer here behaves with reference to his own children. That farmer is a poor creature who skins the land and leaves it worthless to his children. The farmer is a good farmer who, having enabled the land to support himself and to provide for the education of his children, leaves it to them a little better than he found it himself. I believe the same thing of a nation.""
""Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. ""

The other day Trump said
[""I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html)
and then proceeded to tell two Russian diplomats, their aides, and the Russia Today journalist in the room highly classified espionage information.
This is who our president is.
This man is catastrophically?unqualified and unprepared for his job?and, just as bad,?he would never ever ever admit it or accept help, so we are burdened?with the corresponding consequences. A not-particularly-accomplished?high school student could do better. A lot of people are making a big deal out of the fact that he blabbed these secrets to Russians. I think that's sort of immaterial. That he did this with
any
person at
all
is
unbelievably amateurish, immature, stupid, and dangerous
. The Russia thing just adds?an incredibly quality of genius-level?high-impact farce.

Did I mention the Planned Parenthood fundraiser I helped out with last Sunday? My very talented and amazing jazz musician friend gathered all
her
jazz musician friends at a restaurant for a three-hour rotating cast of music, with raffle prizes and a small silent auction. We raised $3000 in small donations!! It was an amazing success. At one point I ventured out to the?part of the restaurant not reserved for the fundraiser?to see if anyone wanted to purchase tickets, which was scary, but people were very receptive, including young men there with their friends. The fight to retain/strengthen?reproductive and economic rights cannot be one that only women fight.
[If men remain passive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ydHjbKaL5A)
, everyone will lose.
...so let's keep going
[Yesterday](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-may-14-2017)
we?re-visited some important actions that might have gotten lost among the Comey stuff. Please look at those if you haven't done 'em. Today I'd like to review an action?from the week?before that might have gotten lost in the health care vote:
Trump has recently selected a prominent anti-choice activist,
[Charmaine Yoest](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-names-anti-abortion-leader-charmaine-yoest-high-post-hhs-n752836)
, as?assistant secretary of public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. He has also appointed
[Teresa Manning](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-contraception-abortion-family-planning-funding-592942)
,?a person who does. not. believe. in. contraception. to head Title X,?our country's only federal?family planning program, which targets?teen pregnancy.
Neither of these are elected positions. Trump has appointed them. They are in charge of our country's direction on family planning now.
Your task
Email, fax, write,?or phone?the
[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact)
,
[Tom Price](http://Secretary@hhs.gov/)
at Health and Human Services, and
[all three of your congresspeople](https://www.govtrack.us/)
. Post your letter/script on your social media or forward it and ask others to email them too.
Script (if you are emailing/faxing, delete the notes to you before sending):
I am deeply disturbed by President Trump's appointment of Charmain Yoest to HHS and Teresa Manning to Title X.
[add some or all of the following]
The decision to get?an abortion is between a person, her faith, and her family. One doesn't have to believe she or he would ever get an abortion to still support the notion that others might choose differently. People get abortions for all sorts of reasons;?to think a person is?not making a careful decision based on her personal circumstances is to disrespect her capacity for independent thought and her?right to self-determination.?It is a deeply?inappropriate decision to legislate.
[and then add this]
Moreover, both Yoest and Manning's stance against birth control is completely counter to their stated goal of eliminating abortions. There is ample evidence from the U.S. and abroad that access to birth control reduces abortions. We can look at our own state of Colorado for their successful birth control programs,
[which have reduced teen?pregnancy,?reduced abortions, and saved taxpayer money all by startling margins](http://www.snopes.com/colorado-birth-control-facts/)
.
[Last paragraph for the White House and Tom Price]
I strongly condemn both of these appointments and will fight every step of the way to retain access to reproductive rights, rights that safeguard opportunity and health for men, women, children, and entire families.

[Last paragraph for your congresspeople]:

Trump has
[delayed making his decision on the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/09/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal--g-7-summit/101475462/)
, which you may remember he had staunchly pre-decided was terrible and should end.
...so let's keep going
Jeff Sessions' behavior has shown he is simply unfit for his role. Tuesday, he advised on a matter that he is supposed to have recused himself from. Does this not open him to legal trouble? Then Friday he released a two-page memo
[urging prosecutors to maximize severity of charges and punishment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-issues-sweeping-new-criminal-charging-policy/2017/05/11/4752bd42-3697-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html)
, despite bipartisan agreement that such practices are unhelpful. Decades of research show that this type of justice policy
[does not deter crime](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/03/criminal-justice)
, especially
[drug crime](http://www.npr.org/2014/12/16/370991710/judge-regrets-harsh-human-toll-of-mandatory-minimum-sentences)
, and that
[from its origin](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/)
to
[now](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/from-wallace-to-trump-the-evolution-of-law-and-order/)
it is absolutely intended to cripple black and brown communities (not because people of color commit more crimes but because
[policing, hearings and sentencing are all much harsher in communities of color](http://thenewpress.com/books/no-equal-justice)
than in white communities). What it does is
[fill prisons](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424059/mass-incarceration-prison-reform)
(we have the
[highest incarceration rate in the world](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424059/mass-incarceration-prison-reform)
by far) and
[the private prison industry has benefited mightily from this](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/05/12/business/private-prisons-benefit-new-trump-rules)
. Former attorney general Eric Holder offered a withering condemnation of Sessions' new policy. Jeff Sessions is stuck in pre-Civil Rights America and wants to pull America back to that time. Eric Holder, the Obama's? attorney general, made an incredible
[statement condemning Sessions' decision](https://twitter.com/EricHolder/status/863058742522388480)
.
We knew this was coming, but it still makes me sick to my stomach. In fact, it's difficult to write a five-minute task, as there seems no adequate response to this gleeful re-dedication to oppression.
Today, register your grave concern about Jeff Sessions' outdated and willfully ill-informed rollback in criminal justice policies.
Your task
Write or call the ACLU, your members of Congress, and the Department of Justice:
Your local ACLU affiliate can be found
[here](https://www.aclu.org/about/affiliates)
.
Members of Congress can be found
[here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members)
but I certainly hope they're in your phone contacts.
DoJ comment form can be
[here](https://www.justice.gov/doj/webform/your-message-department-justice)
, comment line phone number is 202-353-1555. You can also submit a civil rights complaint againt a DOJ employee (that would be Jeff Sessions) through an online form or phone call
[here](https://oig.justice.gov/hotline/contact-doj.htm)
.
Say:
I am appalled by Jeff Sessions' rollback of criminal justice reforms and specific instruction to intensify the harshness of sentences. Decades of research show this policy does nothing to make communities safer, and efforts to get away from this kind of policy have been fully bipartisan. There is no rational reason to return to these policies. [Add one of the following:]
[For the ACLU:] This issue is an important one for me for organizations like you to focus on. Thank you for your hard work.
[Congress:] Please work with your colleagues across the aisle and within your own party to pass measures that will neutralize this backward and unproductive decree.
[AG/Assistant AG:] I urge the Department of Justice to reconsider this unhelpful policy, which has been shown to destroy families, ruin lives, and eliminate stability for children.
It seems to me that local municipalities are really important here for resisting this kind of law enforcement, but that will have to be a five-minute action for another day.

,"Good evening!
Sorry for the late letter. Sometimes I need a minute to let our reality sink in, and sometimes I need like eight hours. Okay:
It's working...
Last week, French people looked at Brexit, looked at the U.S., ignored some hacked emails leaked by Russia, and voted using their reason.
[Centrist Emmanuel Macron soundly beat Trumpist far-Rightwinger Maine Le Pen](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-france-election-marine-le-pen.html)
in France's presidential election. PHEW. This bodes well for the French people, for the economy and integrity of the EU, and for the world.
...so let's keep going
Trump continues to make his actions
[more and more indefensible](https://corrupt.af/)
, and the Republican leadership
[keeps defending him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/comey-trump-mcconnell-schumer.html)

Dear _____,
I am an American citizen who loves his/her country. I am not sure what Donald Trump's goal is, but the result of whatever he is doing is that he is offending reason, convention, ethics, respect for his constituents?and maybe even the law. This week,

. I cannot express to you enough how concerned I am about his mental health and suitability for his role, and, more to the point, for the safety of the country in his hands.
Why do you continue to support him? From down here in regular Americaland, you look awfully bad?either more craven and greedy than can believed or profoundly clueless. And I know you're not clueless.
Where is your humanity? Where is your love of country? Checks and balances only work if all three branches participate. Do your job. You are putting us all in danger.

,"Gday!
It's working...
Remember that rollback in methane regulations the House passed in their giddy zeal to undo everything Obama had done while encouraging total hostility toward any innovation in the energy sector? Inexplicably,
[the Senate failed to pass this rollback](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-idUSKBN18620F)

...so let's keep going
We need to keep the noise up about the highly unusual and highly problematic firing of James Comey. If you don't understand why this is a big deal, read

. There is a real danger that this authoritarian intolerance for independent thought will be aggressively explained away and any pursuit neutralized or trivialized. It is up to Congress to prevent us from sliding into authoritarianism. I'll add that if, as Trump claims, the timing was unintentional and he had no idea this would cause concern, he is unacceptably and dangerously ignorant. The incredibly unwise incident yesterday, where Russian media was allowed into the private meeting between Trump and two Russian ambassadors, confirms this assessment. Trump's combination of authoritarian bent and profound ignorance is too dangerous to go on.
Your task
Be advised These scripts are really long. I want to provide you with arguments supporting your concern in the case of a Trump-enabling congressional office. I also want to address both the firing and the Russian media issue. If you don't have time to call all three members of Congress right now, just do one. Maybe you can do the others later.
First,
[check this list](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/10/us/politics/congress-statements-comey.html?_r=0)
to see how your members of Congress have reacted to the Comey firing.
If your congressperson has expressed concern about the firing, say:
My name is ____ and I'm calling from _____. First, I want to thank ____ for expressing concern about the timing [and nature] of Trump's decision to fire Comey. It is up to Congress to rein in the executive branch's overreaches, whether the overreaches are made through ignorance, power-grabbing, or incompetence. Congress must ensure an independent person with integrity and knowledge become the new FBI director. Congress must censure Jeff Sessions for being involved in the Comey matter. Congress must find a means to have an independent investigation conducted. Congress is the check-and-balance here. I am begging them to do their job.
I am also extremely alarmed that
[American press was not let into the meetings between Trump and the Russian ambassadors yesterday but Russian press was](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/11/russian-photographers-visit-to-oval-office-raises-security-concerns.html)
. If it was an accident, as the White House says, then the people in the White House are exceedingly irresponsible and ignorant and are putting us in danger. This is not a joke. This is our country. And if it was not an accident, that is cause for grave alarm regarding our first amendment rights and our nation's sovereignty.
What more is ______ planning on doing to address the gross incompetence and authoritarian predilections of? the Trump administration? [Listen for answer] And how will _____ hold his/her colleagues in Congress responsible for aiding and abetting this president's overreaches?
And if your congressperson is fine or neutral with the firing:
My name is ____ and I'm calling from _____. I read that _____
[supports/has not commented on/is neutral about](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/10/us/politics/congress-statements-comey.html?_r=0)
the president's firing of James Comey, is that correct? [Wait for answer.] Isn't _____ concerned about the timing? [Wait for answer.] It is the job of the FBI to investigate troubling actions and Trump, who was the subject of an investigation, fired the person in charge of the investigation. Doesn't that concern ____? [Wait for answer.]
Trump had previously enthusiastically referenced Comey's actions to lead crowds to chant ""Lock her up."" You tell me -- doesn't it strike you as highly unlikely that Trump would suddenly be concerned about Clinton's treatment? He may not like things Comey did, but doesn't that particular thing seem out of character? [Wait for answer.]
[If the aide says something about how Democrats wanted Comey fired:] You don't expect me to believe Trump is doing something because Democratic congresspeople told him to, do you? Also that is irrelevant. What we have here is a president who fired the person in charge of investigating him, in the middle of the investigation.
[If the aide references Rosenstein's letter:] It seems clear from various reports that Trump grew frustrated with Comey and so
[asked the DOJ to come up with reasons to fire him](http://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/how-trumps-anger-and-impatience-prompted-him-to-fire-the-fbi-director/2017/05/10/d9642334-359c-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html)
. And Rosenstein does not recommend firing Comey in his letter.
[continuing your phone call...]It is up to Congress to rein in the executive branch's overreaches, whether they are a matter of malice or bad timing. That ______ is covering for Trump's bizarre actions looks very very bad. Here are my requests: If ____ wants his/her constituents to have any trust in him/her, it is crucial that she/he fight for an independent person with integrity and knowledge to become the new FBI director. She/he should also censure Jeff Sessions for being involved, despite his supposed recusal from all matters related to Russia. And ______ must support an independent investigation. Congress is the check-and-balance here. I am begging ___ and his/her colleagues in Congress to do their job.
I am also extremely alarmed that
[American press was not let into the meetings between Trump and the Russian ambassadors yesterday but Russian press was](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/11/russian-photographers-visit-to-oval-office-raises-security-concerns.html)
. If it was an accident, as the White House says, then the people in the White House are exceedingly irresponsible and ignorant and are putting us in danger. This is not a joke. This is our country. And if it was not an accident, that is cause for grave alarm regarding our first amendment rights and our nation's sovereignty.
What more is ______ planning on doing to address the president's mistakes and overreaches? [Wait? for answer.]
Thank you. I am very concerned about Congress's role in enabling the overreaches of this administration, and I am paying attention.

It's working...
And by ""It"" today I mean our
[journalistic media](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-were-learning-to-do-journalism-differently-in-the-age-of-trump)
. Let's hope they, and We the People, can force the Republicans in Congress to adhere to our Founders' system of checks and balances. What we have on our hands today is the distinct possibility of a
[Constitutional Crisis](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/is-the-comey-firing-causing-a-constitutional-crisis)
.
...so let's keep going
Um.
So! Yesterday, Trump
[fired FBI Director James Comey suddenly](http://www.npr.org/2017/05/10/527744909/suspicious-timing-and-convenient-reasoning-for-trumps-firing-of-comey)
. The purported reason was that Comey was unfair to Clinton in July in re her emails. Once you stop laugh-weeping about that incredibly disingenuous rationale, peruse
[this article](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/447463/trump-fires-james-comey-krauthammer-calls-it-inexplicable-do-may)
which recounts how incredibly mystifying the firing is from a conservative's perspective.
Also, Trump fired Comey on the advice of Jeff Sessions.
[You might recall](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/what-you-need-know-about-trump-comey-russia-probe-n757191)
that Comey is investigating the Trump campaign and administration for their ties to Russian agents, and Sessions had to recuse himself from any such investigations because of his own dealings with Russian agents. So the guy who was forced to remove himself from the situation has advised the president to fire the person who is investigating the situation.
Today, bizarrely,
[Trump is hosting Russian ambassadors Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak at the White House](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/05/10/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-russia.html?_r=0)
. If nothing else, this looks really really bad. Is all this deliberate self-sabotage, tremendous incompetence, or boundless hubris?
Your task
Call
[your members of Congress](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members)
today. Right now.
And say:
I am beyond alarmed at the events of the last 24 hours or so regarding the firing of James Comey. Trump's rationale is patently false; it contradicts every word Trump has spoken about Comey and Clinton's emails ever. Jeff Sessions is inappropriately involved, and now
[Mitch McConnell is insisting that there is nothing to see here and let's move along](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/mcconnell-rejects-call-for-special-prosecutor-238206)
. Obviously there must be a fully independent thorough investigation into the whole matter.
[If your member of Congress is Republican:]Charles Krauthammer of the National Review calls the Comey firing ""inexplicable"" and completely destroys Trump's rationale.
[I can send you the link if you like](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/447463/trump-fires-james-comey-krauthammer-calls-it-inexplicable-do-may)
. It just does not add up, given Trump's previous stances on Comey and Clinton and given the fact that the FBI is investigating the Russia ties. If the Republicans want to retain any credibility at all, they must immediately and genuinely work to resolve this Constitutional crisis by agreeing to an independent investigation and not meddling in it.
[If your Republican member of Congress repeats
[Trump's b.s.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-comey-replacement-idUSKBN1861HK)
about how the Democrats derided Comey up til now:] Of course the Democrats felt his public handling of the Clinton emails was unfair. But Comey has been conducting a responsible investigation into the ties to Russia, and we are capable of differing analysis of two different issues. Aren't you?
ALSO:
There are
protests
happening
today
around the country regarding the Comey firing.
1) FIND your local Senate office

2) FIND your local FBI office

3) SHOW UP at 5pm.
4) SPREAD THE WORD. If you can't go, maybe others who learn about it from you can.

Do you remember a few years ago when
[Obama moved to reclassify the Internet](https://www.cnet.com/news/net-fix-title-ii-the-two-words-that-terrify-the-broadband-industry/)
under Title II of the FCC? This move assured protection an open and ""neutral"" Internet, where all sites may be accessed with equal ease. Public goods such as water and utilities are classified this way. The Republicans, serving their broadband-multinational overlords and hell-bent on their mission to obstruct everything Obama tried to do, fought mightily against this change, but failed.
Now, with Trump as president and an Ayn-Rand-Republican FCC head, the Republican Congress is gleefully
[taking an axe to net neutrality measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/dealbook/fcc-broadband-cable-trump.html)
. If you have 20 minutes, please watch
[this excellent newJohn Oliver segment on net neutrality in 2017](https://youtu.be/92vuuZt7wak)
and on what you can do to fight against threats to net neutrality. (Editorial side note: Oliver is so, so gifted at making technical/wonky issues clear and plain as day.)
Your tasks
First, go to
[the relevant proceedings on the FCC comment website](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:((17-108)))
* and leave your comment asking the FCC to? preserve net neutrality and the Title II broadband FCC classification:
1.
[Go here.](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:((17-108)))
2. Click ""Express.""
3. Complete the fields and leave your comment.
4. Tell everyone you know to do the same please!
Next, call your three members of Congress and say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is ________. I am calling to say I support net neutrality and I want the Internet to remain classified under Title II. This is very important to me. I am asking _______ to block any efforts to eliminate these net neutrality guarantees.
*This initiative, which the?Republican Congress calls ""Restoring Internet Freedom,"" of course does the very opposite. The ""freedom"" granted would be the freedom for broadband companies like Verizon and Comcast to manipulate your use of the Internet by obstructing some sites in favor of others. By doing this, they can channel money to themselves and their partners? by making competitors' sites slower/more cumbersome/inaccessible, obliging you to only use the sites that they want you to use.

Last week, the group had a Montana-themed fundraiser, with signature food and drink and a bluegrass band. Group members bought food and drink, someone volunteered their house and someone else had friends in the band...and the group raised $3500 for Quist! Congrats, WEactivate!

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
Unfortunately, in our country, money is inseparable from politics. Fortunately, an informed electorate is pretty important too. Soon after the healthcare vote on Thursday, donations to Democratic challengers in Republican districts spiked sharply.
[Act Blue reported almost $200,000 in donations flooding in?the three hours or so?following the health care vote.](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-05-04/democratic-donation-tracker-spikes-after-gop-health-care-bill-passes-house)
...so let's keep going
Among?the first things that happen?under authoritarian rule are the controlling of information and the silencing of dissenters. We saw examples of both this week:
1)
[A Code Pink protester was arrested](http://wamu.org/story/17/05/05/code-pink-protestor-faces-jail-laughing-hearing/)
at the request of our justice department, helmed?by Jeff Sessions,?for laughing ""at"" Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing. When in U.S.?has an attorney general ever made sure someone was indicted?for a perceived slight to said attorney general? There are two other people facing similar charges.
2) FCC Chair Ajit Pai*
[is investigating Stephen Colbert](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/arts/television/fcc-will-review-complaints-about-colbert-joke-chairman-says.html)
for a crude joke he made about Trump, which was bleeped out as is convention,?during his post-prime-time late-night program. To single Colbert out and threaten him in this way is an intimidation tactic, period.
3)
[The FDA offices received a request from the Trump administration that they turn all televisions to Fox News only](http://www.snopes.com/2017/05/05/fda-tv-monitors-fox-news/)
. The request was complied with fully for a short period of time and then modified?half?the televisions now show CNN and the other half show Fox. In my book, that means?this intimidation tactic did work.
We are watching the manipulation and muzzling of free speech and freedom of expression. Period.
*(Ajit Pai
is also hell-bent on destroying net neutrality but that is a topic for another letter.)
Your task
Write the
[White House](http://whitehouse.gov/contact)
and?the FCC (cc?Ajit Pai, Chairman?Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov,?Mignon Clyburn, Commissioner
Mignon.Clyburn@fcc.gov, and?Michael O'Rielly, Commissioner?Mike.O'Rielly@fcc.gov, as well as completing
[this form](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us)
;?and call all three of
[your members of Congress](http://whoismyrepresentative.com/search/zip/60647)
.
Say:
I am extremely concerned about the FDA's targeting of Stephen Colbert for insulting the president. This is what dictators do. I am extremely concerned about the letter to the FDA requesting they?turn all television channels to Fox. This is what dictators do.
[Take this next sentence?one out for the FCC email/call:]
And I am extremely concerned about the?Jeff Sessions-led?indictment of?Desiree Fairooz?for her perceived insult to Jeff Sessions. This is what dictators do.
[And then this sentence goes for all:]
The Trump administration's efforts to muzzle the First Amendment through silencing and intimidation?are?completely unAmerican and of grave concern.

I am choosing to see the health care mess as a good sign. It is inevitable that we will end up with single payer. There is no other viable choice. Trump, in his miserable unprincipled ignorance,
[said it himself, to Bernie Sanders' spontaneous?delight;](https://twitter.com/allinwithchris/status/860289930722811906)

Yesterday
[Trump signed a misnamed?""religious liberty"" order](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39798989)
that allows people to discriminate against...anyone, really, so long as the discriminators?claim?it's because Jesus told them to. The people most vulnerable?under this law are LGBTQ people, Muslims and other ""non-Christian looking"" brown people, and?women. Part of the order allows companies to withhold insurance benefits for birth control. We. are. still. fighting. for. access. to. birth control.

The health care vote in the House is not acceptable. The House reps need to hear deep anger and strong rebuke. They need to be held to account by their bosses, us. (There is a really great Twitter series on this I read last night that I can't find anymore to put down as a source!?I'll keep looking).
Your tasks
Task 1) Look?at
[this floor vote](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)
. If your rep voted AYE, say:
I am outraged and scared that the AHCA passed. This is a bad bill that will literally?bring poverty and sickness into the houses of millions and millions and millions of Americans. I am holding Representative _______ directly responsible for the passing of this cruel, counterproductive bill. I will never forget this.
If your rep is a?Republican and?voted NAY, say:
I am calling to thank ____ for his/her brave No vote on the health care vote.?I am outraged and scared that the AHCA passed. This is a bad bill that will literally?bring poverty and sickness into the houses of millions and millions and millions of Americans.??I am also calling to demand?that Representative _______ work as hard as possible to restore humanity to his/her colleagues. There is no excuse for inflicting a bill like this on American families.
If your rep is a Democrat (all voted Nay), say:
I am calling _____ to thank him/her for voting against
the Republicans' health care bill.?I am outraged and scared that the AHCA passed. This is a bad bill that will literally?bring poverty and sickness into the houses of millions and millions and millions of Americans.?I am also demanding that Representative _______ work with his/her colleagues to come up with PROACTIVE BILLS that counter the Republicans' many extreme measures. If the Democrats just wait for the Republicans to come up with things, of course they will eventually prevail, because they are in the majority. We MUST here progressive voices in the ring.
Task 2) Please be on the lookout for spontaneous rallies and protests tonight. Please attend.

[acknowledges climate change](https://www.propublica.org/article/trumps-defense-secretary-cites-climate-change-national-security-challenge)
and the enormity of its effects, and has long advocated for reducing dependency on fossil fuels. From his lips to...every other administration and congressional officials' ears.
...so let's keep going
Our tasks have?been somewhat?repetitious the past week or two, but the health care thing is of primary importance right now, so it's with good reason. As of today, the?Republican leadership has thrown a bone to Republican moderates that might allow them to accept this unacceptable bill if they think their constituents aren't paying attention.
Please urge ALL?your people to call their reps.
Folks with Republican reps need to
demand a No vote on the AHCA
. People with Democratic reps need to reiterate that and also
demand alternative, Democrat-sponsored?bills
strengthening the ACA?so the Republicans are not allowed to continually be the only voice in the room on this subject. Thanks to

?Hello, my name is [X] from [CITY]. I am urging [REPRESENTATIVE ] to oppose the updated version of the American Health Care Act, which does nothing to address coverage losses, and still puts people with pre-existing conditions at risk.

despite being in the minority, so they can make a difference here too; plus, frankly, it's their job to find a way to represent the American people.

Then make the appropriate call yourself!

Trump has recently selected a prominent anti-choice activist,
[Charmaine Yoest](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-names-anti-abortion-leader-charmaine-yoest-high-post-hhs-n752836)

,?a person who does. not. believe. in. contraception. to head Title X,?our country's only federal?family planning program, which targets?teen pregnancy.
Neither of these are elected positions. Trump has appointed them. They are in charge of our country's direction on family planning now.
Your task
Write (or phone) the
[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact)
,
[Tom Price](http://Secretary@HHS.gov)
at Health and Human Services, and all three of your congresspeople. Post your letter on your social media or forward it and ask others to email them too.?Script (delete the notes to you before sending):
I am deeply disturbed by President Trump's appointment of Charmain Yoest to HHS and Teresa Manning to Title X.
[add some or all of the following]
The decision to get?an abortion is between a person, her faith, and her family. One doesn't have to believe she or he would ever get an abortion to still support the notion that others might choose differently. People get abortions for all sorts of reasons;?to think a person is?not making a careful decision based on her personal circumstances is to disrespect her capacity for independent thought and her?right to self-determination.?It is a deeply?inappropriate decision to legislate.
Moreover, both Yoest and Manning's stance against birth control is completely counter to their stated goal of eliminating abortions. There is ample evidence from the U.S. and abroad that access to birth control reduces abortions. We can look at our own state of Colorado for their successful birth control programs,
[which have reduced teen?pregnancy,?reduced abortions, and saved taxpayer money all by startling margins](http://www.snopes.com/colorado-birth-control-facts/)
.
I strongly condemn both of these appointments and will fight every step of the way to retain access to reproductive rights, rights that safeguard opportunity and health for men, women, children, and entire families.

that will allow the U.S. to have a budget until September does not take funding away from science or health agencies, does not have money for a wall, and does not have poison-pill riders that kill public health and environmental protections. What?! Maybe this only shows how low the bar has gone that?I am incredibly relieved there's nothing catastrophic in it, but this seems amazing.
...so let's keep going
Your call will be two-fold today.
First, r
emember how decisive the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) was on
[the last AHCA attempts](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-03-23/latest-cbo-score-shows-ahca-would-lower-savings-still-not-expand-coverage)
? Their?assessments of the costs and numbers of people who were going to lose their health care were pretty important. They haven't had time to assess the most recent repeal attempt. Let's demand it.
Secondly, there is a fundamental problem with congressional Democrats' health care stance. Nature?and Congress?abhor?a vacuum (even if the Republican?Congress doesn't believe in science),?which means the Republicans keep hammering on?health care in part because the Democrats aren't.
We all know the ACA (Obamacare) really needs improvements. It's been a frustrating and challenging?ordeal for a lot of people. Well? Democrats? Where are your bills suggesting improvements?
There is a single-payer health care bill in Congress now,
[HR?676](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/)
;?have you heard of it? I hadn't before yesterday.
Democrats and progressives have?allowed the Right to dominate the language and activities for reproductive choice, for school privatization, and for corporate tax loopholes, and?now we are?allowing them to dictate the direction of evolution of our?health care. WHY? Let's ask them.
Your task
Call your House rep and say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I am calling about the latest proposed replacement for the ACA. The
[Macarthur-Meadows amendment](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/447062/american-health-care-act-new-amendment-gains-conservative-support)
appears to only make?the bill
more
hostile to regular Americans like me. Regardless, there should be
no
floor?vote until the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to review and?comment on the amended bill.
[If your rep is a Democrat,
say
]: We all know the ACA needs to be supported and strengthened. Why haven't the Democrats pushed HR?676, and/or come up with additional solutions for strengthening the ACA??It looks to me that the Democrats are giving the?Republicans the opportunity over and over to push?their?awful bills because the Democrats aren't asserting?anything different and?aren't communicating any new ideas?to their constituents. The voters?need something we can get behind and vocally support. What is _____ doing to push HR?676 and?offer fixes to the ACA?
Note: You can
check to
[see if your rep is?a cosponsor of H.R. 676](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors)
. If they are, all the more reason they should be pushing it.

,"Good morning!
First - an error correction?- subscriber MA pointed out that in
[a recent letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-april-19-2017)
I mentioned Jon Ossoff in the?Virginia 6th district?race run-off. Nope - Georgia. My bad. Those soft-g's and old-school ladies' names just melded those states together in my typin' fingers.?Thanks, MA!
It's working
The Republican House?leadership has
[delayed its health care vote until next week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-republicans-introduce-one-week-spending-bill-to-continue-budget-talks/2017/04/27/5157abee-2b3a-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html)
. This means they are facing resistance; yay. (But it also means they will be working very hard all this weekend and next week to change ""moderate"" Republicans'?minds through hook or crook so they can get the thing passed. Apparently there is nothing?
nothing
?more important than destroying Obama's legacy. Hence...)
...let's keep going
I'm exhausted. Are you? I'm frustrated and disillusioned, too. The GOP coming back again and again and again on?health care tells me
[they will not stop, they just](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KeniFoiT-0)
[will never?stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KeniFoiT-0)
.?This would be fine if
[their version](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/27/this-amendment-could-revive-the-gop-effort-to-reform-health-care-here-is-its-potential-impact-explained/)
filled in the weaknesses of the ACA, but it does the opposite. This latest amendment,
[decried by the AMA](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama-urges-congress-oppose-amended-health-care-reform-bill)
,?allows states to waive safeguards for people with pre-existing conditions. You might recall in the past being a woman was considered a pre-existing condition; having a family member diagnosed with cancer was considered a pre-existing condition; having ever sought counseling was considered a pre-existing condition. You might recall being grilled on the phone by a stranger who would determine whether your need for health care precludes you from access to health care.
It just makes me so angry and sad. And scared.
The only thing to do is to vote these people out. Forever. Forever. What are these forces doing in the governance of a
[liberal democracy](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/l/Liberal_democracy.htm)
in the contemporary world??We resist and do damage control until 2018,?and then, that November,?they need Out. Out. Out. But of course that requires laying the groundwork, starting now.
Your task
I hope you called your members of Congress, specifically your House Rep, and you implored your friends in ""moderate"" Republican districts to do the same. If you haven't,
[please do so](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-april-27-2017)
. Oh! Daily Action put all the names and phone numbers of the Republican swing votes.
[Here they are](https://www.facebook.com/YourDailyAction/posts/425189901179663)
(time-suck wormhole warning: this link takes you to?Facebook).
Otherwise, do one of the following today:
Go to
[Sister District](https://www.sisterdistrict.com)
or
[Swing Left](https://swingleft.org)
and be assigned a district that needs you (or find an already-formed group near you), even if you don't plan on volunteering. Just so you know about it.
Donate money to Sister District, Swing Left,
[Flippable](https://www.flippable.org)
, or
[Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com)
. I know, I ask you to donate every other week or so.?It's maddening that money changes things. Campaigns should all be part of a fixed budget provided to each candidate by the administration of the office being run for,?where everyone gets the same money and donations are strictly forbidden. It's disgusting, our system now. But Republicans vastly outspending Democrats in races, especially local races, is what has?fueled their takeover, despite their agenda being far from what people want.
Flippable (or Sister District or Swing Left) and?find one of their focus districts. Call the campaign office of the Democrat running and tell them you support them and you are grateful for them. That's it. No money!
Okay. Happy Friday, Five-Minutesers.

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
People are getting really good at demonstrating in the streets!?There's another march this weekend - the
[Peoples' March for climate, jobs, and justice](https://peoplesclimate.org)
. There are sister marches around the country and the world. If you can't attend, you can donate at the link above.
...so let's keep going
Now, more than ever. It's crucial that
[this amended AHCA health care bill](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-idUSKBN17T2H3)
not pass. As noted
[yesterday](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-apr-26-2017)
, it retains all the awful ?things in the previous Republican ""replacement"" for the ACA?extremely high rates for older people, many millions losing their health care, and program funding that essentially amounts to an enormous?tax break for wealthy people?while
adding
the option for states to decline to protect?people with pre-existing conditions.
Why would they think this?even more cruel bill would pass? Because now that it won't guarantee basic health benefits to anyone,?the Freedom Caucus,?a faction of radically?conservative, ideologically ultra-rigid?tea-party?Republicans in Congress, will support it.
That means passage or not comes down to a handful of ""moderate"" (it's all relative) Republicans.
Call your reps. But also call your friends.
Your task
Please call your reps again and repeat the appropriate?script
[here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-apr-26-2017)
. Even if you called yesterday. Call again. And if you didn't call yesterday, now's your chance!
But also, please spread the word. We need a massive NO resounding across the country. Please?look at the list of reps in the
[photo below](http://pic.twitter.com/AgtciKBrrM)
.
If you think you might have a friend in one of these districts,?PLEASE ask them to call their rep?and?say:
I am asking Rep. _____ to vote NO on the replacement health care bill that is up for a vote this week. It cuts coverage and spikes costs to tens of millions of people just like the previous replacement bills, only this time it also guts coverage for preexisting conditions. Rep ____ and his/her colleagues need to FIX the ACA (Obamacare), NOT try and force it to fail and NOT replace it with something that will hurt and even kill tens of millions of people.
AND/OR,?if you have a friend in any of these states, regardless of district, please ask them to pass this action on to
their
friends.
A reminder: There are big problems with the ACA.
Congress has
a real opportunit
y, in theory,
to strengthen and improve the ACA?fix its problems?and shore up its grounding?but instead they are hoping it will cra
sh and burn.
The initiative needs care and safeguards, since it relies on private insurers, but
Trump has threatened outright to neglect the ACA until it ""
[explodes](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-next-step-20170327-story.html)
,"" and?there is nothing the Congressional Republicans would like better. But neglecting the ACA to death?will massively screw over scores of millions of people. It is just incredible to me that Congress's spite is so deep that that is all right with them.
Your call should include a ""Fix what we have"" component as well as a ""Hell No, MacArthur Amendment"" component. I don't think I put this in the scripts yesterday, but you can borrow from the last sentence in the script above.

Trump's 100th day?in office is coming up Saturday. He got Gorsuch,?rolled back a bunch of Obama rules designed to protect workers and?children (
why???
),?terrorized undocumented people, and rattled war sabers,?but he has been
[unable to get major initiatives based on his campaign promises passed](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/24/donald-trump/how-do-donald-trumps-first-100-days-rate-historica/)
?health care, Muslim bans, his wall, tax reform?and he has had difficulty putting together a functional?administration. He is desperate for a win, and for some reason has picked health care (
[""Nobody?knew it could be so complicated!""](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/27/trump-healthcare-complicated-budget-video)
) as his quick fix this week.

(that's what the?replacement for the ACA/Obamacare is called) in an effort to pass it this week.?It retains all the features of the first two plus also
[takes away protections for people with pre-existing conditions](http://www.vox.com/2017/4/25/15429982/gop-exemption-ahca-amendment)
. This is a bid to win over the tea party Republicans (Freedom Caucus) for whom the first two versions
[weren't draconian enough](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/20/us/politics/health-care-whip-count.html)
.
This bill must be stopped.?There is a definite chance it could pass now
with the Freedom Caucus on board.
There isn't an official record of how your member of Congress was planning to vote the previous times because a vote wasn't called. Democrats are on record for saying No, but please keep up the pressure if you have a Democratic rep. Republicans are a mixed bag: Some moderate Republicans said No because the bill was?awful and some said No because it wasn't awful enough. Please take a look at

[Exxon-Mobile was denied its request for a waiver](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/business/energy-environment/treasury-exxon-mobil-sanctions-waiver.html)
on U.S. sanctions against Russia so it could drill in the Black Sea.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson contracted with Russia for the drilling in the first place in 2014 when he was the CEO of Exxon Mobile.
There are a lot of reasons their bid was rejected, to be sure, but people-led scrutiny of the Trump administration's relationship with Russia and
[people-led pressure on congressfolk for transparency](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/21/white-house-refuses-to-give-exxonmobil-special-waiver-to-drill-in-sanctioned-russia.html)
definitely helped.
This outcome shows the value of contacting our elected officials about Dow Chemical's request, as outlined in
[yesterday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-april-21-2017)
(even if the situation is different, since
Congress seems to care a lot more about national security than about people's health)
. So if you haven't done that action, go for it!
...so let's keep going
Today is Earth Day! And it's March for Science Day!
Heaven and Earth know we've never needed Earth Day more than we do this year. And the March for Science appears to be going strong and that is so exciting! See
[Thursday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-april-20-2017)
for more information about the march and ideas. Read
[this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-march-for-science-is-just-the-first-step/)
for an interview with one of the organizers to learn more.
Your task
1) Tweet about the March or post on other social media:

Finally, Democrats, progressives, and just-plain-not-extreme people are finding their voice. Remember that guy who shouted You Lie at Obama in a joint session of Congree? Joe Wilson, South Carolina Republican?That was among the first in what would be many, many dirty stabs of disrespect toward Obama on the part of the Republicans. I've never forgotten it. Apparently, neither have his constituents.

are rising up. This is not a group known?for being politically riled.?Wouldn't it be amazing if this political era resulted in
stronger
scientific integrity?
Leave it to scientists to be brilliant about capturing results and establishing concrete next steps.?DC is having a next-steps forum the following day.?In Chicago, organizers have put together an expo at the march's endpoint,?so marchers can march right up to different tables to learn how they, too,?can?support and participate?in?scientific efforts around Chicagoland.

It is absolutely okay to attend the march if you are not a scientist.
Are you glad scientists and the scientific method made such things possible
as?ice cream, long-distance trips,?weather reports, clean water, the Internet, music, and freedom from a huge array of deadly diseases? Then?you are welcome to attend.

,"Good afternoon!
Did you make your calls from yesterday? If not,
[do it now](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-april-18-2017)
. We'll wait for you!
It's working...
I can't really claim this?overwhelmingly positive news, but
[Democrat Jon Ossoff forced a run-off](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article145331159.html)
in the Virginia 6th District special election. This isn't super awesome because?Democrats poured a ton of money and attention into this run and the Republican vote was split;?an outright victory looked very achievable. Nevertheless, a run-off is better than a Republican victory.
...so let's keep going
Trump Secretary of Education?Betsy DeVos recently
[rescinded two Obama-era laws that helped?students avoid defaulting on?their student loans](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/betsy-devos-rolls-back-obama-era-student-loan-guidance-n745701)
. There is literally no good reason for this. The rationale?was about saving taxpayers money...it does not save taxpayers money to have people default on their loans.
She is a huge school-""choice"" (school privatization) advocate. Charter schools, online schools, vouchers allowing students to go to private schools,?and similar programs are punctures?draining our?public school system, which is?already terribly?weakened by a refusal to acknowledge and address socioeconomic inequities, the follies of massive testing, and the continued devaluing?of teachers. There is
[no evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/02/27/devos-favors-private-school-vouchers-but-new-study-says-they-dont-offer-real-edge-over-public-schools/?utm_term=.8ed5ef276f6c)
that privatized school options benefit students.?Public schools are the backbone of our society, and
[market forces such as privatization?options will ravage them](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/is-school-choice-really-a-form-of-freedom/523089/)
.
Anyway, DeVos and the privatization?movement
[must be stopped](https://networkforpubliceducation.org/9121-2/?link_id=3&can_id=5d9ef3e02d7616fc44cc4e38ae26086e&source=email-congress-is-on-recess-a-great-time-for-your-rep-to-get-schooled&email_referrer=congress-is-on-recess-a-great-time-for-your-rep-to-get-schooled&email_subject=congress-is-on-recess-a-great-time-for-your-rep-to-get-schooled)
. It is an experiment that will yield even greater societal inequities and it will absolutely lower the schooling experience for huge numbers of students. When the bottom line is dollars, there is basically no incentive to provide anything more than the basics, to individualize or enrich instruction, to ensure anything more than the required minimum. There is every incentive to cut corners. Schools are also places needing maintenance, places that feed hundreds of kids, centers of community. All of these things, as well as, of course, the classroom instruction and atmosphere,?will suffer as we move our education system from one valuing public access to one valuing profit. Thanks to
[this action-items?site](https://www.solidaritysundays.org/action/)
for some of the language in today's script.
Your task
Call Secretary DeVos at?1-202-401-3000. Call your members of Congress as well. Say:
My name is ______ ?and I'm calling from ______.?I'm calling because I am concerned about the rollback in the student-loan regulations. Our country is?alone among?our peers in how we?saddle our young adults with huge loans in the first place; the very least we could do is provide education and support to help them pay it off. ?I am also very concerned about this administration's enthusiasm for?school privatization measures such as charters, vouchers, and other market-driven?programs. Schools should simply not be places to experiment with?market forces. The
only
bottom line?should be children's education and development. Secretary DeVos and others who support this supposed school ""choice"" are killing our public schools rather than giving them the help they need. Public schooling is?a backbone of our democracy and a vehicle for the American dream we all cherish.
Please pass my comments along to ______.

The rest of us, please call tomorrow morning (or leave a message, but then you can't ?demand an answer).
Your task
Call your members of Congress and say:
My name is ____ and my zip is _____. Every day there is some new way Donald Trump or his family?are taking money out of the pockets of Americans and putting it in their own. Ivanka's company benefits richly from her position. Same goes for Trump's companies, and Melania's companies! Taxpayers are paying for Trump's incredibly expensive security at his incredibly?frequent golf games. Taxpayers are maintaining a luxury home in New York and one in Florida, as well as the White House. Trump is hiring lobbyists into influential policy-making positions without following ethics rules.?And then there are the unreleased taxes. And there is so much more.?It is beyond belief. What are [member of Congress]'s options for holding him accountable? Why isn't (s)he doing so? [Wait for an answer.] I would like an answer [Wait for rationale or dodge.]?Please take my contact information. I would like to hear ______'s response to this corruption and some concrete steps (s)he will take. Thank you. [Leave your contact information.]
A note
I recommend everyone play
[this?game](https://fiscalship.org)
about balancing the budget.?I'll confess that one reason this letter is so late today is because I was playing this game for...a while.?I only lowered the budget 27%, but I gave all kids preschool and all families paid family leave; I ramped up climate change action and made sure our national research agencies were funded; I got rid of zillion-dollar military toys and took steps to support veterans; and I retained health care and reined in the excesses of the 1%. It was EXTREMELY satisfying to make decisions to build?my dream country, after a very frustrating and depressing...let's see...Reagan...36 1/2 years.
I also played a second time as a Paul Ryan Tea Party Ayn Rand type and, while it showed how coddling billionaires balloons the debt, and eliminating things like PBS does almost nothing for the debt, it doesn't make clear the social consequences of punishing?children, poor people, and sick people for existing (that might have been taken into account in their estimate of whether the debt goes up or down, but that wasn't clear to the player). Anyway it's pretty interesting.

Your task
Go
[here](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=EPA-HQ-OA-2017-0190)
to write your comment. Use a starter like one of these:
The EPA needs to be strengthened, not weakened. We all benefit from clean air and water.?Yesterday on the way to work I drove past _____...
It is easy to forget how much something that is in place does for us...the memory of what it was like without it fades.?Please don't make this mistake.?I used to live in _____ in [years]?...

scule amount of wilderness area left in our country. Almost everything has been turned into farmland, residential land, or corporate development. ?We must take care not to tip the balance so far that we can never go back.??____ in my community used to be abundant; now we are excited to see a few per year. These drastic changes need to be addressed.
And then?add
A?brief personal story
about fuel efficiency, cleanliness of a lake in your area,
smog, air pollutants
Another area of personal story is with illness or injury?a family member who suffered from asthma, lung disease, or another illness or injury caused by lack of regulation at a time past, or someone who is suffering now because of regulations that are not strong enough or are being ignored.
Farmers in your family? Experience with farm workers? They suffer a lot from pesticides. Share a personal story you have.
And end with something like:
We all are healthier with a strong EPA that works for the people.
You and the people you care about rely as much on the EPA as the rest of us. Please keep the EPA strong and effective.
The EPA makes an important difference that we all rely on.
Shout-out
To the Chrome plug-in that replaces?pictures of Trump with?pictures of kittens. When I clicked on the Houston hotel story, this is the image that greeted me:

[Tax March](https://taxmarch.org/local-marches/)
, taking place in D.C. and around the country.
Where is the one
[closest to you](https://taxmarch.org/local-marches/)
?
Not only that people are still paying attention, but, one hopes, a shift in how the issue is characterized and by whom. As
[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/14/tax-march-democrats-become-party-revolt-amid-rising-inequality/100456942/)
says,?""the coalition of almost 70 progressive groups is trying to take ownership of an issue ? taxes ? which Republicans have championed for the past 25 years, culminating in the formation of the conservative Tea Party about eight years ago."" It's time to TAKE THIS ISH BACK. And that's what it looks like we're doing! We just need to keep going...
...so let's keep going
By the way, if you are interested in transparency and honesty and fairness, check out
groups such as Common Cause, Demos, People for the American Way,?Public Citizen, the Sunlight Foundation. (These and many others are also supporting the Tax March). And if you can't attend a march (or even if you ?can),?post about one in your area or about some big ones around the country on social media, to spread the word.
But wait! There's another?concrete action to do today.?Trump wants to know what we think of his executive order to investigate and ""reorganize"" every single agency in the country. Let's tell him.
Your task
Go
[here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/reorganizing-the-executive-branch)
and fill out his survey. I mean, he asked.

on some unsurprising but frustrating steps Attorney General Jeff Sessions is taking:
Jeff Sessions is moving to end the National Commission on Forensic Science, a panel of about 30 independent forensic scientists enlisted by former President Obama to raise forensic standards. They will be replacing this with an internal department crime task force.?Investigating improving forensic science, a science that can tip the scale of justice, should continue to be independent, and not controlled by those looking to prosecute.
Your task
Call your senators and house rep. Say:
Hi, my name is _____ and my zip code is ?_____. I'm calling to ask _____ to speak out of the elimination of the National Commission on Forensic Science by Attorney General Sessions. Having an independent view of forensic science is an integral part of protecting people from wrongful prosecution. Already many convictions have been overturned because it was proven that an innocent person had been languishing in jail?sometimes for decades. There is no legitimate reason for turning back the clock on this progress in criminal justice.

April 15 is Tax Day, and we are still?waiting for Donald Trump to release his taxes. He said he would and then didn't; he said the American people don't care but we do. We care that he is flouting a courtesy extended by presidential candidates for generations, we care that?he said he'd do it and then dodged it, we care that he seems prone to?kleptocratic?interests. House Republicans
[have blocked two more recent attempts](http://fortune.com/2017/03/28/donald-trump-taxes-tax-returns/)
on the part of the Democrats to acquire Trump's taxes.
Your tasks
First,
[find a tax march in your area](http://taxmarch.org/local-marches/)
and try to?make a point to go Saturday. Numbers are important. Bring your friends and family. If you can't go, post about it on social media, including the time?and location, to make it?easy for others to go. Examples:
--Tax march this Saturday! Show Trump how much his lack of transparency bothers us. [location and time info]
--Trump thinks the American people don't care about his taxes. He's wrong - tell him so. [location time and info]
Secondly, call your House rep and your senators. Say:
[If Republican]:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _________.
I am disappointed that once again the Republicans in the House have refused to require that?President Trump provide his taxes. Trump is refusing?a simple courtesy to the American people that?every?president has offered for generations. Why are the Republicans okay with this? We will not forget. He went back on a promise and the Republicans are enabling and excusing it.
[If Democratic]: My name is ______ and my zip code is _________.
I am disappointed that once again the Republican House has?refused to oblige President Trump to provide his taxes. Trump is refusing
a simple courtesy to the American people that?every?president has offered for generations. I am asking ______ to find other ways to keep this issue alive and require Trump to follow?through on his promise. We will not forget. He went back on a promise and the Republicans are enabling and excusing it. We are relying on you to hold the president and your Republican colleagues accountable.
THIRDLY,?remember you bought all those postcards a while ago? No? Rule of thumb for These Times: always have postcards available. Some time Saturday or before, throw one in the mail to Trump. Include your name and ideally?your full address, but if you don't want to do that just put your zip code. Write anything along the lines of?""The American people are still waiting for your tax returns. You promised!"" Rainy spring-break day? Perfect kids' activity!?Here's the address:

Last night, all over the U.S. Jewish families got together to observe Passover, a holiday that, through symbolic foods at a big meal, retells the story of how the Jews?found a new home after?fleeing Egypt as refugees. There are always modern-day parallels to the details and the messages of the stories told around the table. But Trump and Syria have really shined a light on the relevance of?the Passover story, and this year, families all over the country incorporated modern-day refugees' stories into their Passover seder with
[this guide](https://www.hias.org/passover2017)

[seemed to have done basically no damage](http://abcnews.go.com/US/syrian-jets-off-air-base-hit-us/story?id=46646770)

.
I don't know where to begin making sense of this, and I'm not going to try.
What I'm going to focus on is this: Trump said some oddly uncharacteristic, religion-y?stuff about how he is bombing the base because
[children of?God](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/08/syrian-warplanes-take-air-base-bombed-us-tomahawks/)
[suffered and died](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/10/donald-trumps-action-syria-proves-not-league-putin-says-son/)

Oh, that's right - no he hasn't).?Yet his refugee policies remain cruel and uncompromising.?If you care about the welfare of children in a war zone, do not explicitly and loudly and internationally proclaim ""

[If you are Jewish, riff off this:] This week is Passover. Every year at this time, my family marks our ancestors' condition as refugees who had to?flee?from suffering and death. The Passover story is about the Jews' flight from Egypt, but?it is a story that has been repeated over and over?in Jewish history.?Jewish people have had to flee every corner of the world at some point?and?I am here alive today because someone took us in, over and over.

[subject-matter experts](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/04/07/congress-goes-recess-resistance-movement-gears-round-two)
are offering everything they know.
...so let's keep going
Let's connect today's task to the ""It's working"" segment.?It's April recess for our members of Congress, and they are supposedly at home communing with their constituents.?Are yours?
Your task
Find out if your elected officials are having townhalls
[here](https://townhallproject.com)
,?and find out what your community members are doing to meet with their members of Congress
[here](https://www.resistancerecess.com/event/resistance-aprilrecess/search/)
and
[here](https://www.resistancecalendar.org)
. These are populated with user-contributed data so if you know about something that is not on these calendars, go ahead and add it.
If a member of Congress of yours is NOT listed on the Town Hall resource above, call a home-state office. Say:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _____. I am calling to see if ______ is having a town hall in the next couple weeks, during spring recess.
If No, say: That is disappointing. There are a lot of really important things going on right now and it's essential we are able to talk with our elected representative. Might _____ reconsider and hold a town hall? [after the response]
Thank you. I'll let everyone I know that unfortunately we won't have the chance to hear or speak with ______.
If yes, say: That's great. When and where is it? Thank you for the information. I'll pass it on to everyone I know.
And then do. Pass it on to everyone you know.
Shoot anyone who IS having a town hall a note on Facebook, Twitter, or webform, or phone them, to thank them. Note the dates and locations on your calendar. Even if you know you can't go. Simple awareness is a good and needed step.
It's OK if you're not planning on going. Pass along what you learn about your Congressfolks' schedules, one way or the other.
If you can go, fan-freakin-tastic. Look at the sources below for good information on this recess's issues.
THANK YOU, FIVE-MINUTESERS!

,"Good morning!
It's working...
I see fewer opens and?fewer new subscribes, and a slight uptick in?unsubscribes. That is totally all good; the letter is?here to help, and if the letter isn't helping, it doesn't need to be in one's inbox.?I'm going to posit, I'm just going to posit, that the reason for the reduced engagement is that?people have found other methods of robust?civic participation and are spending their time there:
People might be focusing on work with a community organization, such as Indivisible, the local chapter of the Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters,?or their own representatives'/candidates' campaigns.
People might be focusing on?organizations that help bring resources to weak-blue or weak-red (for challenges) districts, such as Flippable, Swing Left, Sister District, or Code Blue.
People might be another small-action website?or letter, such as daily action, or getting action alerts from Here to Stay, Planned Parenthood, or others.
People might be running for office!!! :) Do you know anyone running for office who never would have thought about it before the election? Let me know.
I hope it's true! What I hope is not happening is that people are getting used to how things are, or feeling like their actions aren't?mattering?and giving up.?I confess I've certainly felt that way. This spring has been challenging and busy for me in the way Life makes things challenging and busy sometimes, mostly work related, and?it has made?it awfully hard to care about other things when my vision and focus has been telescoped?to mostly a single distance point. I don't do my own actions every day (though I usually do them eventually).?But I am continuing to write and act?because, if a mass of us does,?when we look back, we will see we?have not only made a difference on individual issues, but we will have changed the dynamics of our very democracy: more progressive participation on all levels, greater responsiveness on the part of the elected people, more support for journalism and entities that protect our rights, greater awareness of our civic duties and rights?and the different those make.
So let's keep going

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
There is a special election in Kansas that should not at all?be?an issue for the Republicans, and
[it is an issue for Republicans](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/gop-is-getting-nervous-about-special-election-in-kansas.html)
. This is amazing but true.
[James Thompson](http://elections.flippable.org/elections?id=FKSH004)
(thanks for the link, Flippable!)?is running for U.S. House District 4, which is open because Mike Pompeo, who was the rep there, is now the CIA director in Trump's administration?and?the Republicans are actually indicating some insecurity about the outcome of this race. So exciting!
...so let's keep going
The?Kansas election?referenced above is taking place
Tuesday. Let's help.
If you've been following this letter for any length of time, you know I don't often?ask you to donate. I already asked you this week and donating is also?one of two options today. That's unusual and I make an effort to space these things out. The things that make our democracy go 'round are: 1) money, 2) participation and education, and 3) money, and that is the damned?unfortunate truth,

Your task
Go

,"Good evening!
It's working...
I'm going to return to yesterday's example of?how successful the Democrats were in races?this week?in traditionally Republican places here in Chicagoland, because now I have a comprehensive list.
[Look](http://ildcca.org/2017/04/proft-rauners-millions-democrats-make-historic-gains/)
at this list of wins!
So let's keep going
Unsurprisingly, Mitch McConnell trashed the Supreme Court nomination?filibuster in order to ensure that he will get his way, and all the Republicans went along with it?
[even the ones that thought it was a horrible idea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-nuclear-option-helps-senate-mccain-whoever-says-that-is-a-stupid-idiot/2017/04/05/d9d73aec-1a1a-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html?utm_term=.82f42323afb8)
. I guess this is why the GOP wins?they vote as one, like
[the Borg](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg)
(and without regard for where their collective drift is taking them and those around them on their?nightmarish singular quest, also like the Borg...). The
[exceedingly conservative?Gorsuch](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/16/519501771/judge-gorsuchs-writings-signal-he-would-be-a-conservative-on-social-issues)
is headed to the Supreme Court, in a seat that
[should have been Merrick Garland's](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html)
a year ago.
The best thing to do is to run a whole bunch of progressive people and dominate all the elections to come such that the House and Senate, over time, will wash Mitch McConnell and his ilk?right away?into a sea of blue.
Your task
Pick a place that cultivates progressive people running for office and give money to it. Even $5. Yes, you'll get on their email list. Just unsubscribe if you don't want to hear from them.
[She Should Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/)
supports progressive women interested in running for office. So do a bunch of other organizations.
[Run for Something](https://www.runforsomething.net/)
supports progressive millennials interested in running for office.
[314 Action](http://www.314action.org/home/)
supports scientists and others with STEM backgrounds?interested in?running, as a way to combat the assault on climate change science and other science.
The
[Victory Fund](https://victoryinstitute.org/trainings/candidate-campaign-trainings/)
helps LGBTQ candidates.
The
[New American Leaders Project](http://newamericanleaders.org/programs_training.html)
helps immigrants run.
The
[Progressive Change Campaign Committee](http://boldprogressives.org)
supports and counsels progressives of any?demographic
interested in running, as do various other places.
And so on.?There are more listed in this article and on this page
[here](http://www.pantsuitresources.com/run-for-office.html)
(scroll down past the WA state stuff?unless you live there of course!).
(Anyone have a lead on an organization that supports people of color interested in running?)
Pick a place and donate a little bit. Every little bit counts.

,"Good evening!
It's working...
Here in Chicagoland, we had elections in our local suburban districts yesterday. Many Republicans in traditionally Republican districts?ran unopposed, because the deadline for entering the race closed soon after the election, while progressives were still reeling; and there were many cases where the Republicans in such districts?won. But! There were plenty of
[notable wins](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/news/ct-nvs-naperville-lisle-township-democrats-election-st-0407-20170405-story.html)
for?Democrats in these districts,?as well as
[very tight?near-wins](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-governor-race-bolingbrook-20170405-story.html)
in districts that felt airtight for their Republican incumbents a few months ago. We gotta keep it up!
...so let's keep going
You know who's calling their elected officials?every day??Women, that's who. One recent survey found that
[86% of calls to Congress are being made by women](http://www.themarysue.com/women-86-percent-resist-trump/)
, and the phenomenon's been confirmed
[elsewhere](http://wapo.st/2oKGx82)
.
And you know who isn't calling? Men.
Apparently
[they don't?think it works](http://melmagazine.com/yes-women-are-making-nearly-all-the-protest-calls-to-congress-in-the-trump-resistance-fba6e003049d)
.
But they're wrong, and they need to step up, because while it's working now, it won't if the astounding numbers and energy subside, plus right-wing forces surprised by the force of the progressive opposition now are sure to regroup. This isn't a sprint, it's more of a...maybe a relay race. Or a marathon where everyone is one another's cheering friends on the sidelines. The men right now have stepped away from the race course in order to watch lip-sync battles on their phones and we need them.
Your task
Whether you are a man or a woman, reach out to one man who you know is concerned about Trump and Trumpism but is not active, and ask him to act. Give him some concrete tools: suggest he subscribe to a daily or weekly to-do list such as Five Minutes: Small Steps for a Big Impact (this letter) or Daily Action (on Facebook) or
[Re:Act](http://us14.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=34bf9c62b5c76a26e2e6e912d&id=877859f17f)
or a local Indivisible group or Flippable, or any other source you think will help him. If he says it won't work give him some of the many ""It's Working"" examples from this letter, and give him
[this](http://melmagazine.com/yes-women-are-making-nearly-all-the-protest-calls-to-congress-in-the-trump-resistance-fba6e003049d)
essay.

,"Good evening!
It's working...
Here's exactly how these things work...a friend of mine who lives in the Bay Area woke up November 9 feeling despair, like so many of us. After talking with a friend on her block, they?decided to host a group of neighbors?to talk about what could be done.
[Here's](https://elainesir.com/political-action-groups/)
a blog post she wrote about it.
The group met regularly, and, over time, decisions got made. First, they came up with ideas for plans of action. Then?subcommittees?researched those ideas, and then, following some discussion,?they decided that,?being in a deepest-blue district of a deepest-blue state, their course was to?lend?their support where it was more needed. They?joined Sister District?and have been assigned a?vulnerable/flippable?district to support?through phone banking, awareness-raising, fundraising, and so on as 2018 approaches; until that race kicks in, they do the same for consequential special elections around the country.
And that, my friends, is how ish?gets done.
...so let's keep going
I know I sound like a one-issue-pony lately with the Supreme Court nomination, but it's consequential and multi-pronged. Please bear with me as we give this critical mess the attention it requires.
[So!](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/us/politics/senate-democrats-appear-poised-to-filibuster-gorsuch-nomination.html?_r=0)
It worked! There are enough senators filibustering Gorsuch's nomination for him to not be confirmed?that is, unless McConnell pulls ""the nuclear option"" and changes the rules to require fewer senators to confirm the nominee. McConnell has kicked dents our democracy's integrity
[again](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/strict-obstructionist/308344/)
and
[again](https://www.thenation.com/article/caught-tape-what-mitch-mcconnell-complained-about-roomful-billionaires-exclusive/)
and
[again](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-shameful-gamble-on-merrick-garland-pays-off/2016/11/10/05f79dd2-a780-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html?utm_term=.3e13a1911610)
in order to consolidate personal and political power, and?he is threatening now to do it again. (As happens with these things, if you are a complete jerk, you create new problems; in this case,
Gorsuch's
filibuster is a direct consequence of
McConnell's outrageous?hijacking of Merrick Garland, Obama's Supreme Court, pick a year ago.)
How to respond to a
[dead-eyed?bully and his gang](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/DeathEaters.jpg)
who dig?in and glower harder?when you stand up to them? Find some friends,?stand taller, and flex your muscles, your brain and your courage. That's our Senators' job, yo.?Your task is to remind them of that.
Your task
Call your Senators and leave a message (or call tomorrow morning).
If Republican:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I am calling to tell Senator ________ that I do not support Mitch McConnell changing the rules in order to push through Gorsuch's nomination. Senator McConnell has already done a lot of damage with?his actions regarding Merrick Garland last year. If he hadn't have done that, the Supreme Court?wouldn't be in the mess it is in now.?If Senator McConnell?makes good on his threat to go nuclear, he is going to sow even more dysfunction?and anger, and he is going to weaken the entire Republican party. Please urge your leader to?back away from this pitfall and instead?work to reconcile the Merrick Garland debacle.
If Democratic:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I am calling to tell Senator ________ that I?support the filibuster of Neil Gorsuch. Since?Mitch McConnell is threatening to change?the rules in order to get his way, the next essential step is to stand up stronger to Senator McConnell. I urge Senator _______ to work with his/her party to develop immediate and strong?consequences?should?Senator McConnell make good on his threat and?change?Supreme Court nomination rules. Don't back down, and do come up with next steps should he go there, and do make those next steps public. Thank you.
Note, some Democrats are not supporting the filibuster and are voting to confirm Gorsuch, but I think this script?as written could apply to them as well.
Notes
I've been getting these letters out very late in the day; that has?proven more sustainable with my other daily obligations. However, I recognize that?even if speaking practically any actions delivered the night before?can easily?be done the following morning,?receiving a call to?action in the morning is somehow more satisfying and galvanizing.
I've been?reluctant to send letters that were written the ?evening before?because so much has happened?each day that I've feared the letter would?lose relevance;?but the pace of things does seem to be slowing down, or maybe it's just that we've now gotten used to the level of absurdity. It might take me a few days to transition to that method, but I'll do so shortly and?we'll see how it goes.
THANK YOU, FIVE-MINUTESERS!

Good evening!
It's working...

Apparently the note I got said?TinyLetter's spam filter didn't?like either of these?urls, for some reason. I have had no issues with either and, at least insofar as ourstates goes,
[this Slate article](http://www.salon.com/2017/03/30/fighting-back-at-the-state-level-anti-trump-resistance-goes-granular-with-our-states-a-map-based-organizing-project/)
both confirms the
case that state-level stuff is exceedingly important
and reassures me that
the site is legit.
...so let's keep going
Last week we saw?an assault on common-sense environmental protections. In the sneaky,?criminally dishonestly named HONEST Act,
[the House voted last week to restrict the EPA's use of science](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/326380-house-votes-to-restrict-epas-use-of-science)

And
[Scott Pruitt has rejected a ban on a pesticide known to cause brain damage](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/epa-insecticide-chlorpyrifos.html?_r=0)
in farm workers and children, claiming there isn't enough proof of this, er, widely proven effect, and therefore?using exactly the same denial-based logic?that we heard from tobacco company execs for years and years.
And,?with Scott Pruitt by his side,?Trump issued an executive order implementing
[a plethora of rollbacks on climate-change action](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/28/politics/donald-trump-climate-change-executive-order/)

Your task
Call your House Rep and Senators and leave a message,?or call tomorrow morning to talk to a person, or use the awesome

to fax them from the comfort of your own text-message?app.
Say:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _____. I am calling with alarm about the attacks this week on the part of the House, Scott Pruitt, and Donald Trump. I am opposed to HR1430,?which would greatly reduce the EPA's ability to do its work. I am?opposed to the use of insecticide [chlorpyrifos]?that?Pruitt is keeping in circulation, of which there is ample evidence showing how it damages brains, especially in children. And I am opposed to Trump's measures rolling back common-sense climate change actions to no conceivable benefit, economic or otherwise. I would like to know what Rep./Senator _________ is going to do to fight back against these measures. Please contact me at _______.

Use their tweets, which I have posted as a screenshot below?(but eliminate the word ""today,"" since the vote happened last week). You can also tweet your own rep using modified versions of?the same tweets besides the people on this list, all other Reps voted along party lines (Aye for?Repubs and Nay for Dems);?you can double check your Rep's vote

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
[Overten thousandwomen have contacted Emily's List since Election Day looking to run for office](http://emilyslist.org/news/entry/EL-announces-over-10000-sign-ups-since-election-day)
. Emily's List is an organization that recruits, trains, and supports pro-choice female candidates for political office.
It takes a while to get one's feet under oneself...this is just the beginning. Ten thousand women. Fifty states. Just think about what we're building.
As the Emily's List president says in the press release, ""Ten thousand women isn't a ripple...it's a wave"" (my ripple metaphor from
[yesterday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-march-30-2017)
not withstanding, hah).
...so let's keep going
Today's action thanks to
[Your Daily Action](https://www.facebook.com/YourDailyAction/)
on Facebook.
[Mitch McConnell speaks confidently that Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed for SCOTUS](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/when-will-neil-gorsuch-be-confirmed-to-supreme-court-236599)
, implying that he will ignore the strenuous objections of Democrats and simply change the rules in order to get his way.
Background:?As
[I've talked about previously](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-march-20-2017)
, the damage McConnell wreaked on our democracy when he wouldn't allow Merrick Garland's nomination is simply inexcusable. He must be held accountable for it.?For this reason and others (like Trump's corruption/collusion imbroglio), and with many thanks to YOUR calls and letters,
[more and more Democrats are planning to filibuster](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SENATE_SUPREME_COURT_COOL-?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)
. Therefore,?McConnell is threatening to eliminate the filibuster from the Supreme Court nomination process in order to get his way.
If he does, that's on him. If the Dems back down and let him get his way,
AGAIN
, with his intimidation and bullying, that's on the Dems. It's time he got his lights punched out. Er, politically. Metaphorically.
Your task
Read through the scripts and pick the one that fits for your Democratic or Republican senator.
If your Democratic senator is planning to filibuster (check his/her website/Facebook page), say:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _____. I am calling to thank Senator ______ for pledging to filibuster Gorsuch's nomination and to ask him/her to stay strong. The Democrats need to stop backing down in response to McConnell, who is a bully who has made a career of putting party and power over country. McConnell will take and take and take until the Democrats stop giving in. No one but Garland should be considered for the vacant Supreme Court position. These problems are squarely the fault of McConnell and he should know that.
If your Democratic senator has not made a statement about filibustering, say:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _____. I am calling to ask Senator ______ to make a stand and filibuster Gorsuch's nomination. The Democrats need to stop backing down in response to McConnell, who is a bully who has made a career of putting party and power over country. McConnell will take and take and take until the Democrats stop giving in. No one but Garland should be considered for the vacant Supreme Court position.?These problems are squarely the fault of McConnell and he should know that; but if Senator _____ and his/her colleagues allow themselves to be intimidated by him, AGAIN, the fault will lie with them.
If you have Democratic Senators Heitkamp or Manchin, who are planning to vote Yes on Gorsuch:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _____. I am calling to express my great disappointment and concern that Senator [Heitkamp/Manchin] plans to confirm Gorsuch for Supreme Court. (S)he is enabling the Democracy-killing power plays of Mitch McConnell, who hijacked the Supreme Court nomination process last year. McConnell is a bully who has made a career of putting party and power over country. He will take and take and take. He must be stopped, and it is Senator ______'s responsibility to do so. No one but Garland should be considered for the vacant Supreme Court position. I would like to understand how Senator _____ justifies his/her vote in light of McConnell's actions. [If they can't tell you right then:] Please have him/her contact me at ______.
For your Republican senators:
My name is ____ and my zip code is _____. I am calling to say I oppose the confirmation of anyone for the Supreme Court except Merrick Garland. Mitch McConnell stepped completely out of bounds by hijacking Garland's confirmation process. In doing so McConnell sullied his whole party and damaged the integrity of the democratic process. He must be held accountable and the action must be righted. Therefore, I oppose Neil Gorsuch's confirmation and expect Merrick Garland to he given his hearing. Senator _____ is supposed to be more than a rubber stamp for Mitch McConnell and his unAmerican, awful ideas. I expect to see some independent thought. Thank you.
THANK YOU, FIVE MINUTESERS.

It's working...
[Even Trump's fans know he's lying](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/03/26/donald-trump-voters-we-like-the-presidents-lies.html)
. They just don't care, because they like that he's scaring the bejeezus out of everyone in Washington. The destruction of our democracy and our livable Earth seems a high price to pay for the chance to watch D.C. d-bags get their comeupance, but it's certainly an interesting perspective.
This article is maybe a bit of a stretch for the ""It's working"" section. I'm claiming it a victory that pretty much everyone in the country knows that nothing he says has basis in reality.
...so let's keep going
I'll be honest, it's hard to keep going. The consequences of this election no longer feel?like an exception that is easy to make time for; life is closing back together, sealed tight with?normalcy and responsibilities,?and the demands of everyday moments?are reclaiming their space. Meanwhile,
[awful things keep happening](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/03/30/vice-president-pence-breaking-tie-senate-moves-against-planned-parenthood/99820022/)
.
But we have to keep going. That's all.
First of all, what choice do we have? What would happen if we stopped?
Secondly, it IS working, despite the lost battles and the backslides (that's why it's called struggle; that's why it's called resistance).
[It is working](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/whats-next-for-the-keystone-xl-pipeline/520917/)
, and it is working because
[people are showing up](http://taxmarch.org)
.
Your task
Write individual things you've done that have made a difference. Items might be specific phone calls made, or town halls attended, or dollars donated, or subscriptions purchased, or tweets sent, or emails written.
Now write down at least three
people
you've influenced to act. It could be a small change in perception or awareness, a conversation, a postcard sent or letter written, another pair of feet marching or a seat filled at a town hall.
Think about the people touched by those five acts and three people. And the people touched by them, and so on. Think about
[pebbles dropped in a pool of water](http://c8.alamy.com/comp/AGHAN0/raindrops-hitting-water-surface-and-creating-ripples-AGHAN0.jpg)
. With enough pebbles dropped, there is nowhere on the water that goes unaffected by ripples touching ripples, merging with and moving each other.
Look at your list. Take heart. Take a breath. Look at
[this cute picture](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/nu9ZLqiq2SA/hqdefault.jpg)
of a fluffy?baby loon riding its parent's back. Tomorrow: Mitch McConnell.

The Republicans tried again to pass their health care bill,
[and failed again](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act.html?_r=0)
. Their attempted changes were not to make it less horrible, but to make it more so, thanks to the ""Freedom Caucus"" led by Tea Party Republican?Mark Meadows (NC-11). The Freedom Caucus had hoped to?force Paul Ryan to strip away some or all of
[these ten](https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/10-health-care-benefits-covered-in-the-health-insurance-marketplace/)
""essential health benefits""?that the ACA (Obamacare) guarantees:
1. Outpatient care
2. Trips to the emergency room
3. Treatment in the hospital for inpatient care
4. Care before and after your baby is born
5. Mental health and substance use disorder services: This includes behavioral health treatment, counseling, and psychotherapy
6. Prescription drugs
7. Services and devices to help you recover if you are injured, or have a disability or chronic condition. This includes physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, psychiatric rehabilitation, and more.
8. Lab tests
9. Preventive services including counseling, screenings, and vaccines to keep you healthy and care for managing a chronic disease.
10. Pediatric services: This includes dental care and vision care for kids
There is an eleventh as well?the right to have health care despite?pre-existing conditions?because, without the?essential coverage listed above, you would be denied the care you need for your pre-existing condition.?I mean those ten things above really cover everything except unexpected disasters.
...so let's keep going
It is a win that this cruel?bill didn't pass. However, at least half of the reason?it didn't pass was because it wasn't right-wing enough for the Freedom Caucus.?We must make sure the next attempt is more, not less, respectful and usable to humans.
An added bit of information:
[in a phone call with a Washington Post journalist today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/president-trump-called-my-cellphone-to-say-that-the-health-care-bill-was-dead/2017/03/24/8282c3f6-10ce-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html?utm_term=.945475f353e8)
after the Ryan bill failed, Trump said?he plans now to just?let Obamacare ""explode"" so he can blame the Democrats. This political act will take real actual people down with it.
Choose one of those key protections listed above?(I mean, or more, but for a five-minute task, choose one). Write down why it is vitally important. A personal story is best. If you are a man and you choose something that is ""women's health care"" (your wife's mammograms saved her life, your daughter's Obamacare delivered her two babies),?even better, since these lawmakers seem incapable of understanding that old men's bodies are not the default human body and all others an inconvenient and embarrassing?exception.
Your task
Write
[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact)
and fax
[Paul Ryan](https://faxzero.com/fax_congress/R000570)
and
[Mark Meadows](https://faxzero.com/fax_congress/M001187)
the following letter:
Dear President Trump/Paul Ryan/Mark Meadows,
When you try to take away basic health care protections, it is very difficult to see your?humanity. No other industrialized, reasonably functioning country does this to?its citizens.?If it weren't for [your chosen item], [put your thoughts here as to why this thing is vitally important].
You might be hoping to withdraw all support and resources for the ACA and?wait for it to fail, so you can blame the Democrats. In doing so, your victory will be pyrrhic, because you will have ruined the lives of millions of people, and in some cases literally ended their lives. We need strong health insurance that respects the basics needed?to keep our entire population healthy. Single-payer would be best. [Add the following?for Donald Trump] Just imagine what a winner you will be if you push single-payer health care through. Everyone will love you. You will be a hero.
Sincerely,
[Your name]

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
The vote on the ACA replacement
[has been postponed](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/23/gop-leaders-scramble-to-get-lawmakers-behind-obamacare-replacement.html)
!
This is widely seen as a blow to Paul Ryan and to Trump.
This has a lot to do with the ultra-conservative Tea Party wing of the Republican House, the Freedom Caucus, thinking the bill doesn't go far
enough
in restricting services (they want to weaken requirements for?maternity care and substance-abuse treatment, among other things). But it
also
has to do with ""moderate"" Republicans balking at the harsh, expensive, inequitable bill.?Which means it has to do with your efforts! Thank you!
...so let's keep going
What we don't want to have happen is that the Republicans appease the Freedom Caucus by
[making the bill](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/23/521220359/gop-health-bill-changes-could-kill-protections-for-people-with-preexisting-condi)
[even more harsh](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/23/521220359/gop-health-bill-changes-could-kill-protections-for-people-with-preexisting-condi)
, and then the moderate
Republicans cave because their constituents have lost focus
. So we need to keep the pressure on. I know we've called a couple times already, but's very important to follow up when the Trumpist administration and Congress suffer setbacks to make sure they don't simply pivot and recover.
Your task
Call your House and Senate elected officials (regardless of party and stance) and say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I want to call to say I'm glad the vote for Ryan's current health care bill has been postponed, and I'd like to reiterate my grave concern over any bill resembling that one. We need to make the excellent parts of the ACA?even better?while reigning in the influence of the insurers so that?health care?becomes?more affordable and stable. [Choose some or all:?I support care for families and for people starting families, including maternity care; how is increasing birth risks helpful to anyone in our society???I support Planned Parenthood. I support meaningful Medicaid and Medicare coverage. I support a ban on lifetime caps, which severely hurts people with disabilities.?I support mental health care and substance abuse care. I support a ban on discriminatory pricing and on?pre-existing condition pricing. I support sharing the responsibility of health care across everyone in our society; cherry-picking features we individually want to support?is completely antithetical to the point of insurance and is very naive.][Add a story of your own if you have it.]

The House is expected to vote on
[the replacement for the ACA](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-march-8-2017)
tomorrow. This plan is basically
[a tax-cut?bill benefiting the rich](http://https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/acha-tax-cut/518889/)
. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)?predicts that 24 million people who currently have health care will lose it by 2026 if this bill is put into law. It defunds Planned Parenthood, which is essential care for millions of women, and it vastly reduces the reach and depth of Medicaid. It retains the measure that keeps young people through age 26 on their parents? insurance and that bans discrimination for pre-existing conditions, but it throws coverage for a wide variety of other things, including mental health care and childbearing, into question. It puts an immense amount of pressure on states to make up for where this bill would fall short. It denies

More local news from my corner of the nation. Read

on some folks' in-person meeting with Pete Roskam (R, IL-6). Specifically, read the writer's excellent, well-prepared, truthful, and unflinching response after Roskam asks why, if he is not representing his constituents, he keeps winning elections?? The writer and her associates were prepared and focused, and could not be distracted.
...so let's keep going
FBI Director Comey
[testified before Congress yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/politics/fbi-investigation-trump-russia-comey.html?_r=0)
and laid bare all the lies and delusions swirling around this president. Comey affirmed that Obama did not order any wiretapping; that Russia sought to hurt our democracy, hurt Clinton, and help Trump during the campaign; and that the FBI is investigating collusion between Trumpist and Russian agents during the election.
Your task
Call your Senators. Say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is ______. I am calling about James Comey's testimony before Congress yesterday. Comey said there was no wiretapping done by Obama on Trump, and that the FBI is investigating collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russian government.
[If your Senator is a Republican:] I am asking Senator _________ to publicly stop supporting Trump and his policies. His tweets alone, before the hearing and then in response to the hearing, show that he is a delusional and juvenile man who constantly misleads and lies. His doubling down when he is shown to be incorrect or lying is incredibly disturbing. We are relying on this Republican Congress to do the right thing and save the country from this dangerous figure. How does Senator _____ plan to act? Please let me know by emailing/phoning me at...
[If your Senator is a Democrat:]
I called yesterday to express my outrage that anyone except Merrick Garland is being considered for the Supreme Court and demand that all other nominees be filibustered until Garland has had a hearing. Here is further reason to block all candidates right now: James Comey's testimony. Gorsuch was nominated by a delusional, dangerous man who won the election thanks to the efforts of a hostile foreign power and who now regularly tweets?tweets!?complete lies and wild accusations. Any nomination should be blocked until a complete and thorough investigation of everything we can learn about Trump and his election is completed.
THANKS, FIVE-MINUTESERS!

Remember the postcards we sent March 15 for the Ides of Trump? Look at
[this fun blog roundup](http://elisabethparker.com/ides-of-trump-postcards/)
of various postcard parties around the country. Did you send yours? Better late than never! As usual,?I forgot to post my own contribution here. It's below.
...so let's keep going
[Neil Gorsuch's hearing started today](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/politics/judge-gorsuch-supreme-court-confirmation-hearings.html)
.
Gorsuch is up for the Supreme Court seat that was
[stolen from Merrick Garland](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-shameful-gamble-on-merrick-garland-pays-off/2016/11/10/05f79dd2-a780-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html?utm_term=.a232071efc5e)
in a Constitutionally violent old-up-and-hostage situation perpetrated by?Mitch McConnell. Of all the blood-curdling, partisan things McConnell has done, I think this?might be the worst.
Unlike many of Trump's choices for running our country,?Gorsuch is a real judge with experience and some respect for his field. But
[he is extremely conservative](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/who-is-neil-gorsuch-bio-facts-background-political-views-234437)
and?will most likely vote along with the other four conservative judges on the Supreme Court. Cases almost certain to be coming down the pipeline in the next say five years include challenges to marriage equality;?religious?freedom/freedom from religion;?abortion/women's privacy rights and human rights;?Internet-related privacy rights;?Internet-related access rights;?health care;?Citizens United (the root of much of the destruction of our democracy);?regular people's financial well-being, privacy, and options;?the viability of our public education system;?police power and accountability;?and responses to climate change.
We are at a crossroads with some incredibly important issues.
If McConnell hadn't pulled his seat-stealing stunt, I would ask folks to urge their Senators to thoroughly vet Gorsuch and then vote No, but honestly there wouldn't be much to do about his being eventually appointed, no matter how much one might?disagree with and fear his stances on issues that directly affect our lives. BUT. The reason he is even up for the seat is because of McConnell's unprecedented hostile squatting.
The nomination belongs to no one except Garland. Even if Garland were voted down following?the hearings, he deserves a hearing. Every candidate for this seat should be filibustered until Garland gets his hearing.
You may have heard that there is some?fear that McConnell will pull
[the nuclear option](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/03/6-questions-answered-about-nuclear-option-filibust/)
and get rid of the filibuster option for Supreme Court hearings altogether in order to get Gorsuch nominated. The Democrats MUST NOT be cowed by this threat. They MUST?stand up and act in offense?rather than preemptively cave out of fear of?their?power-crazed?colleagues. The Democrats' fear is part of the reason we are where we are.
Your task
Call your senators today or tomorrow morning. Say:
I am calling to tell Senator ______ to?ask tough and thorough questions of Gorsuch's record and beliefs regarding?other people's freedoms and opportunities. In addition I am demanding that Neil Gorsuch's nomination be filibustered. No candidate should be considered until Merrick Garland is given his hearing. Mitch McConnell's theft of the confirmation hearing from Garland must never be forgotten and must be responded to. Mitch McConnell's move damaged the?integrity of our democracy and that damage must be repaired.
[If you are speaking with a Democratic senator's office]
I understand there is a possibility that McConnell will eliminate the filibuster option as a result, but I am sick of Democrats making moves purely out of fear of what Republicans might do. I am also sick of Democrats claiming they are?taking?the high road, when actually they are just tools being manipulated by?the Right.?Let the Republicans suffer the consequences if McConnell does such a rash move. There has been no high road for a long time, just a road to irrelevance, and?we've?put ourselves in great danger because of it.?I am demanding a FILIBUSTER on Gorsuch and on EVERY candidate until Merrick Garland is offered a hearing. Thank you.

,"Good evening!
You may have noticed I have been erratic in my delivery of these letters?of late. It's been a busy busy month for work and I apologize for the inconsistent schedule.?I?hope you are able to complete actions in the evening or the following day.
It's working...
Mennonite communities have a history of doing social good, but
[they are getting louder about?resisting](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a53717/mennonites-protest-trump/)
Trump's bigotry?against immigrants. A coalition
[even went to the Women's March](https://themennonite.org/daily-news/mennonites-join-womens-march-washington/)
.
So let's keep going
You have probably heard about
[Trump's proposed budget](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/visual-guide-winners-losers-trump-s-budget-n734386)
. It makes
[significant cuts](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/16/politics/trump-budget-cuts/)
to
every
department, with the most?crippling cuts?slashing through?the EPA, State Department, the Labor Department (all cuts are in workforce-development?programs for elderly and youth)?and the Department of Agriculture.
It decimates??FEMA funding for disasters and entirely
eliminates?NOAA
coastal and marine efforts
?two of so many examples of making policy based on?wishing really hard that climate change?weren't true.
It also
completely eliminates
the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, public broadcasting (NPR, PBS),?Americorps and its sibling programs,?federal afterschool programming, and many other programs that express our very humanity. It
completely eliminates
[funding for maintaining the health](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-presidential-budget-2018-proposal/?utm_term=.1b1b50123220)
of the Great Lakes (the largest freshwater system on Earth); the Chesapeake Bay;?environmentally consequential areas near the border with Mexico;?and many other natural treasures.
The three departments getting beefed in the budget are Homeland Security, including $4.4 billion for his
[stupid wall](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/46565)
, the Department?of Defense,?and Veteran's Affairs, which includes $4.5 billion for veteran's health care, which is great, but if you are helping vets become healthy while destroying the society they risked their lives protecting, you are lighting your own tail on fire.
I understand that our nation's?budget is impossibly complicated and that it is naive and inaccurate to impose?a sort of this-for-that equivalent. But.
[Trump's personal spending of taxpayers' money](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/17/how-much-is-donald-trumps-travel-and-protection-costing-anyway/?utm_term=.27d3e9318d39)
?multiple hundreds of millions of dollars a year on Melania and Barron's residence in New York City and security for Trump's weekends at Mar-A-Lago?makes these cuts all the more sickening and offensive.
Your task
Choose one of the programs listed above, or one of their products:?for example, public art, or cultural explorations, or free educational TV, or youthful?volunteer experiences, or afterschool classes, or science and weather data, or services after a natural disaster, or a healthy water system near you.?Jot down specific ways you, your kids, your parents, your neighbors?have benefited from these programs.
[Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-presidential-budget-2018-proposal/?utm_term=.1b1b50123220)
is a?list?of specific organizations and cuts, but it's OK to, for example, think about art or culture programming that affected you without being certain of the NEA's role. A government that supports the
arts, education, scientific research, safety measures, and?services for vulnerable people has a ripple?effect on ALL?other programming support and resources,?down to your neighborhood park.
That's it. Pick one. Set a timer.?Make a list. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, just a list.
And we'll pick up from there tomorrow.?See you then. So, so sorry for this late hour.

,"Hoo boy. Good evening. This'll have to be a fast one!
It's working...
By ""it"" this time, I mean our system of checks and balances.
[Trump's Muslim Ban 2.0 was blocked](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-03-15/federal-judge-in-hawaii-blocks-trumps-new-travel-ban-hours-before-implementation)
the night before it was supposed to go in to effect?by a couple judges for being an obvious rewrite of a stated wish to ""keep Muslims out.""
...so let's keep going
The House has already passed a?bill that will
[all but eliminate class-action lawsuits](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/985)
. Class action lawsuits
are
[a valuable civil rights tool](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/08/a-critical-civil-rights-tool-is-on-the-chopping-block#.XQY0UeLul)
as well as
[one of the few tools left for individuals](https://www.buzzfeed.com/coralewis/republicans-in-congress-are-moving-to-limit-class-action-law?utm_term=.toNmg99mr#.dqRAMxxAE)
who suffered
injuries on their person, finances, freedom, family, and so on from the actions of?a large organization or corporation.
The Republican bill was?introduced by Bob Goodlatte (R-Va), the same guy who introduced
[that?bill to?eliminate?the House ethics office](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jan/03/house-gops-ethics-vote-what-was-all-about-anyway/)
on day 1?of this Congress and
[a number of other blood-curdling bills](https://www.govtrack.us/search?q=bob+goodlatte)
; his bill makes?the requirements so high that class-action lawsuits will be all but dead. The Republicans are going full-steam ahead undoing public-good policies going back to FDR's social security/medicare/employment protections, through?LBJ's Civil Rights and War on Poverty legislation,?and of course including?Obama's environmental and human-rights protections. They are getting what they've been aiming for for generations.
Anyway, the Senate is expected to vote on this bill soon.
Your task
Please
call your?Senators and say:
My name is _______ and my zip code is ________. I am calling Senator ________ to?ask him/her to
FIGHT
HR 985, the bill that severely limit class action lawsuits. People need protections from large powerful entities.?[If you have a story about how you were part of a class action lawsuit against an entity that was exploiting or hurting you, definitely tell it.]

,"Good morning!
It's working...
Remember
[I told you a story last month](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-4-2017)
about my mother's representative, Pete Roskam, who has refused to meet with concerned constituents and in fact has disrespected them repeatedly by insisting, both in public and in letters to supporters, that?they are plants or outsiders? He has begun to meet with people in small groups about the ACA and, while it is highly unlikely he will adjust his partisan,?conservative stance too much,
[he has expressed concern](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20170314/BLOGS02/170319944/roskam-blinks-on-ryancare)
in meetings?and publicly?for the changes to Medicaid in RyanCare, evidently in response to his (real, actual) constituents.
...so let's keep going
Today is the
[Ides of Trump](https://www.theidesoftrump.com/#theidesoftrump)
; tens of thousands of people around the country are sending a postcard to Trump expressing their displeasure. Unfortunately, there is not a?more specific message; it would be a more effective campaign that way. Still, though. Power in numbers.?Remember to keep a stack of postcards in your house to make actions such as this easy. You can buy pre-stamped postcards from the post office for I think $0.53.
Your task
Lcate a postcard. Please include your zip code and?name on it. Send it to?1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?NW, 20500.?Here are some ideas for your message:
Immigrants are part of the fabric of America! Shame on you!
Demand an end to violence and harassment?against Jewish centers and mosques!
Your hateful words about my fellow Americans are deeply offensive to me and millions of others.
We are concerned about your constant lying. You need psychological help and your lying is a danger to our country.
You promised you'd release your taxes. Where are they?
Come clean on your relationship with Russia.
BANNON NO! BANNON NO! BANNON NO!
By installing white nationalists in our highest offices, you have perpetrated?a shameful act on a country I love.
We all have to breathe air and drink water. Stop the assault on our environment.
If you believe women are humans, then you should know that women's rights are human rights.
You lie constantly, don't know how democracy works,?and have cruel and uninformed ideas. Resign!
...there are so many more.

It's working...
Organizations working to flip districts, such as Flippable, are
[learning and getting more efficient and stronger](https://www.flippable.org/blog/2017/3/12/iop43l5pg4vlk3sble9dqcamyt3m48)
. The movement is maturing, with no flagging in site. Keep it up!
...so let's keep going
Trump's ill-conceived and poorly implemented?changes to immigration enforcement policy and the xenophobic rhetoric surrounding them has led to
[great fear in immigrant communities](http://www.sunherald.com/latest-news/article134610779.html)
?not just among undocumented people but among legal residents and citizens, too. This is because implementation has been
[capricious and arbitrary](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-immigration-detention-deportations-enforcement/)
. People here legally are being detained or questioned because of how they look, and?while Trump has claimed he will prioritize people who have committed serious crimes, this has not been the practice. Trump is
[requiring local law enforcement to act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/26/trump-wants-to-empower-local-police-to-enforce-immigration-law-raising-fears-of-racial-profiling/?utm_term=.6662a342f390)
as ICE agents, which at best will take law enforcement away from their primary duty of ensuring safety and order, and at worst will empower some to engage freely in racial profiling and intimidation. Trump also wants to hire 10,000 new ICE agents, which would
[triplethe current number](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/23/516712980/trumps-plan-to-hire-15-000-border-patrol-and-ice-agents-wont-be-easy-to-fulfill)
.
Task 1
First, help people know their rights.
Take a screenshot of
[this](http://unitedwedream.org/thank-deportation-defense-card-handy-phone/)
information (English is at the bottom) that everyone should know if ICE comes knocking on their door,?and send it to at least one other person and/or post it in social media and ask others to share.
[Here](https://www.aclu.org/files/kyr/MKG17-KYR-PoliceImmigrationFBI-OnePager-English-v01.pdf)
is some more detailed information that addresses various other situations (at home, at work, in the car, etc.).?And
[here](http://iamerica.org/know-your-rights#workplace)
are those various situations, again, but in?easier-to-read posters on specific subjects. These resources are also in a variety of languages.
Task 2
Then, call your Mayor and/or your police/sheriff's office* and say:
I am concerned about Trump's policy of obligating local law enforcement to do immigration enforcement. Our local law enforcement already has an important job to do and if they are doing a different job they can't be there to serve and protect. I also don't feel safe if people are afraid to call 911 or other emergency?help, which will happen if authorities are deputized to serve as ICE agents. I also fear the increase in immigration enforcement will create arbitrary searches and mistaken detainments?as it already has. What are you as a [city/police force/sheriff's office] going to do to make sure the people in our town/county are able to stay?safe and are being treated fairly?
[If they say there is nothing they can do, you can add] If you think that, I urge you to discuss the issue further.?This is your municipality and your responsibility is to the safety of all the people here. ICE should do their jobs properly, with the required warrants and processes, and our local law enforcement should be allowed to do their jobs properly, without interference from ICE.
*
[Here's](https://peoplepower.org/freedom-cities.html#toc-9model)
a full plan for engaging our local law enforcement. If you're interested in being a part of it, you can find a group working on this plan at
[peoplepower.org](http://peoplepower.org)

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
Today...beginning right this minute, actually...the ACLU is hosting
[a resistance training](https://peoplepower.org)
, in response to?the #MuslimBan and so much more,?for people who want to?combat?Trump's abuses. House parties all over the country will tune into a?livestream video and then have a discussion about what they can do in their communities. Unfortunately, I can't attend one today. But do you know who is attending one? Thousands and thousands and TENS of thousands?of people! All over the country ?
[here's](https://map.peoplepower.org)
a map. (If you want to watch the livestream on your own?you can,
[here](https://peoplepower.org)
, and it will also be available as a recording after the fact as well.)
...so let's keep going
If you have been doing these actions, you might now be on a bunch of people's mailing?lists. This might be the case, for example, if you've given money to any of the flippable-district races, or if you've signed up to learn more about a certain issue.?It can get burdensome, but, hey, guess what? It's resolvable! Your action today is to cull your inbox a bit.
How is this an ""action item""? Because if we open our email and immediately feel annoyed or overwhelmed, we are not going to act. We need space in order to move.
Note:?Maybe the annoying prospect of getting on an email list has?stopped you from doing actions. Please don't let it stop you. We need you.?Take one for the team and unsubscribe when needed, or use a separate?email address.
Your task
We could probably spend all day going through our email box! But yeah, let's not. Set your alarm for five minutes. Do you hear from candidates of whom you're not a constituent? Unsubscribe. Pitches you never look at from organizations you never donate to? Unsubscribe. Pitches you never look at from organizations you DO give to? Unsubscribe. Create a calendar alert for giving instead. Things you totally want to get to but you realize you never ever do and there are twenty unread, starred emails waiting for you? Read some, and/or unsubscribe.
Lists are king for elected officials and issues organizations, but we individuals need to stay productive and organized, too.
If you wish, when the box comes up asking why you unsubscribed, write that you appreciate and support all their work but you will stay up to date on their efforts by other means.
What to keep? Keep things that you read and act on at least, say, once every three to five emails. Keep your own elected officials' emails. If you are actively following other elected figures, even if they're not yours, obviously then keep those.

Yesterday, Scott Pruitt stated that

.?""I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
There is not tremendous disagreement. There is

I promise I won't keep making this section of my letter about my own representative ?all the time, but I have one more story related to this week's town hall. One of the first questions our representative?took at Monday's town hall?was from my neighborhood's Indivisible Group. Melanie thanked him for his progressive stance on many issues, but also pointed out that as a long-time, well-liked?rep in a deep blue, very safe district, he has a responsibility?to speak out on a greater variety of issues, and to be a wrench?in the gears of the Trump administration. She also presented him with a large picture, complete with an actual wrench embedded (below, and sideways - sorry).
Well, today, when he spoke on the House floor of his?opposition to Trumpist policies, he closed his speech by saying ""My constituents demanded I be a wrench?in Trump's cruel agenda, and I Mr.?Speaker, do not intend to disappoint them."" Watch the video
[here](https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/videos/10155089994983205/)
. I guess our reps ARE listening!
...so let's keep going
Trump's choice of administrator for?Medicare/Medicaid is Seema Verma, a person who, at least, has experience in her role, so at least we are dealing with the more traditional sort of horrifying candidate. She has been the main force shaping
[Indiana's health care policies](http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/16/pick-head-medicare-medicaid-gives-few-policy-views/98007892/)
under Mike Pence as well as some other conservative states. She has been supportive of providing
[block grants](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/upshot/how-would-republican-plans-for-medicaid-block-grants-actually-work.html?_r=0)
for states to use at their discretion, that familiar trope that is fairly guaranteed to provide worse coverage and coverage for fewer people, and is especially hard on people with disabilities. She has also supported things like work requirements, which reinforce
[our country's obsession with equating poverty with immorality](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/27/506348147/the-future-of-medicaid-may-be-found-in-indiana-where-the-poor-pay)
, and mandatory savings accounts for health care for people making as little as $12,000 a year.?She thinks coverage for
[maternity leave should be optional](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/trumps-pick-for-medicare-and-medicaid-wants-to-cut-mandatory-maternity-coverage?utm_source=vicenewsfb)
.
This evening, let's call our senators and also our governor and leave messages. So many costly responsibilities are going to be kicked down to the states, SO many. Our governors, need to be prepared for their Republican Congressional colleagues' leaving them so up a (polluted, EPA-less) creek.
Your task
Call your senators and say:
My name is _______ and I live in _______. I am calling to ask Senator _______ to please challenge Seema Verma's appointment to Medicare/Medicaid administrator. Please press her to?answer?very specifically what changes she plans to make to Medicare and Medicaid, and slow down her appointment as much as possible. Her ideas about ""personal?responsibility"" pass moralizing, patronizing, and uncompassionate judgment on poor and unwell people and people trying to juggle multiple responsibilities. Her notions about maternity leave are short sighted and hostile to men and women expecting children and those?with infants. Having a family should not be considered an unseemly luxury.
Call your governor and say:
My name is _______ and I live in _______. I am calling because I am very concerned about Seema Verma likely being confirmed this week as the head administrator of Medicare/Medicaid. She will almost certainly kick these programs down to states as block grants. We have seen that block grants mean greater struggles for people who are already struggling, especially children and adults with disabilities. [Personal story if you know someone with a disabled family member.] We have also seen that ""tests"" for honesty and diligence imposed on people so they can access their health care are complicated and messy, and expensive, too. It's always better to be prepared. Any?of us could need these services, even you. Things happen. People lose jobs. People get sick. How is [state] preparing to adequately cover all its people if Seema Verma is confirmed?
THANK YOU, FIVE-MINUTESERS!

,"Good morning!
It's working...
Monday I went to my rep's town hall meeting. There are usually a handful of people at his town halls, he says. Look at the image below. And that was well before it started! People continued to?stream?in until the walls were?three?people?deep, and?apparently there were people waiting around the block who couldn't get in.
...so let's keep going
The following?summary thanks in large part to
[Re:Act letter](http://us14.campaign-archive1.com/?u=34bf9c62b5c76a26e2e6e912d&id=99da9476ba&e=02ce18aa8c)
.?On Monday Paul Ryan released The Replacement, which he calls the American Health Care Act, AHCA (personally, I think it's not coincidence the name is so close to the ACA, so the Republican Congress?can take advantage of the confusion and take credit where it's not due to them, but I can't source that from anywhere except my own self). He gave committees until TODAY?two?days?to review this monumentally important bill. He is asking for a vote prior to its receiving its score from the?Congressional Budget Office (CBO). (For the record, if we're keeping track of hypocrisies here, Ryan was strident in requiring the ACA be reviewed by the CBO prior to any vote.)
The proposal raises costs?for poor people and?older people and?provides tax cuts to wealthy people. There is no penalty for not having insurance, but insurance companies can add a 30% penalty, payable to them, if you lapse coverage. The bill?retains the popular ACA provisions of not discriminating for?pre-existing conditions and of covering?people up through age?26 their parents' coverage.
The bill will cut off?the Medicaid expansion, which currently covers 11?million people, in 2020, and in 2018 will?eliminate?the modest taxes levied to pay for the?ACA, though there is no explanation of?where the difference in funding?will be made up. The bill will
[defund Planned Parenthood](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/06/house-gop-releases-plan-to-repeal-replace-obamacare.html)
in starting 2018 and in 2020 levy
[dramatic changes to Medicaid](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518864390/gop-bill-would-repeal-obamacare-taxes-and-penalties-keep-some-subsidies)
that entail poorer coverage to fewer people. Companies are no longer required to provide their full-time employees with health insurance.
The bill provides?cheap, bare-bones plans?that will suffice for young healthy people willing to take a risk,?but then we're back to the pre-ACA problem of people needing more care having insane costs because the cost is not distributed across the population and of people being woefully undercovered when something unexpected happens.
Overall, m
any millions of people are estimated to lose their insurance as a result of this bill.
We are a society. We are young people and old.?We?are sick people and healthy. A healthy person can be sick tomorrow. Wishing all this weren't the case won't make it so. Once again, the Republicans are creating policy based on what they wished were true, instead of what is true. That is their theme of the era.
It has far from universal Republican support. Tea-party types in Congress don't like it?because it?doesn't balance its budget.
The bill was kept in secret until Monday and, now presented?committees have had two to three days to review it and the CBO has not had time to review or comment on it.
[Here](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means)
are the people on the House Ways and Means Committee.
[Here](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_Committee_on_Energy_and_Commerce)
are the people on the Energy and Commerce committee. Is?your rep in one of these committees?
Your task
TODAY?call your House rep first, then your senators.
Say:
My name is ______ and I'm calling from _______.?I am calling to ask _____ to demand a transparent process for?Paul Ryan's AHCA. This means any votes must wait until the CBO has had a chance to review and provide a score, and committee members and floor members have had adequate time to review and discuss. Can I count on _______ committing publicly to such a transparent process?
Notes
a) Today is International Women's Day and there is an admittedly-hard-to-participate-in women's strike. (Imagine what would happen if EVERY WOMAN laid down her work at home and on the job for the day. It would be an incredible statement, and a lot easier to participate. But, alas, we did not?organized enough for that). If you can, don't do paid or unpaid work, and tell people why. Otherwise, wear red,?do any necessary shopping and business?only at women-owned businesses, and tweet/post your support for women. You too, dudes.
b)?Did you guys get through to your governor and the president yesterday (as well as your members of Congress)?regarding Muslim Ban 2.0? Do call your gov. Mine clearly hadn't been pressed on how he was going to support and protect?Muslim?people in my state.?His office would?benefit from hearing from other Illinoisans. I also did get a chance to leave my comment for Trump, after waiting?on hold for several minutes.

Trump has released his
[new executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/travel-ban-muslim-trump.html?_r=0)
banning Muslim people?from entering our?country, and it is, predictably, the same cruel and capricious?decree meant to make brown-ness generally and Muslim-ness especially akin to?criminality. The changes are intended to shield the order?from being immediately thrown out in court, nothing more than that. After the ban ends, if it does, it will be?followed by?a ""
[worldwide review](http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/trumps-divisive-new-travel-ban?)
"" that requires other?countries to provide us information we demand about?their citizens, so we may decide if they may enter. So we are now imposing our capricious,?divisive identifiers on other countries; we are not only destroying our own democracy, but contaminating other countries with our bigotry.
Your task
Or tasks. You have multiple calls today, but just get 'em done, one-two-three(-four-five) and you're done!
First, call the president.?202-456-1111 or 202-456-1414.
Say:
I am an American [citizen] and I am calling because I love my country. Your executive order yesterday?to ban people from six Muslim countries?stomps on so much of what I love about my country. My country is a place for opportunity for all. My country is a place of religious freedom for all. This disgraceful order is unjust, unAmerican,?and will not make us safer.?I am wholly against this horrible order and anything like it. Shame on you.
Then, call your
[House Rep and your Senators](http://govtrack.us)
. This script ripped wholly from
[NIAC](https://www.niacaction.org/virtualrally/)
? thanks, NIAC!
Say:
My name is ____ and I live in zip code ______. I am?strongly opposed to Trump?s new executive order re-imposing a ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries. This disgraceful order is inhumane, unjust and un-American and it must be stopped.
The new order, like the original order, is an outrageous assault on American values. It will tear apart families and do nothing to make us safer. I urge the Senator to take immediate legislative action to rescind both orders and ensure that the Trump administration cannot implement its plans for a Muslim ban.
Can I count on the Senator/Representative to take legislative action to rescind the ban?
Then, call your governor.
Say:
My name is _____ and I live in zip code _____.
I am
strongly opposed to Trump?s new executive order re-imposing a ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries. It is unjust and un-American and won't make us safer. It is causing fear and panic among our Muslim neighbors in [state], with reason?hate crimes have gone way up across the country. Muslims in our state are valued members of our community and?contributors to our economy. I?would like to know some specific steps for?how Governor _____ plans to protect and support Muslim [your?state-ans]. I'd like him/her to write/call me with an answer.

If you're fired up,
[check](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h76)
how your?House rep voted and tell them you are disgusted that they voted for this resolution/you are glad they voted against it.
Note
Energy flagging? Mine is. It feels redundant and puny to keep calling every day. It feels remote from what is?unfolding in D.C. and across the land.
We are going to lose a lot of battles, but we are going to win?a few at first, and then more as we press on. Through our concerted actions, we are changing the rules of engagement, the potency of various weaponry, and the numbers on the field ?(extended war metaphor FTW!).
That's incredible!
We've already changed so much, starting with ourselves. Think back to what you were doing at this time last year. How many papers were you subscribed to??Did you have?your U.S. members of Congress were programmed into your phone? How frequently did you call them? Did you know who your?state assembly members were? Did you know about?community meetings taking place? Marches??Imagine you?times a million: We are unbelievably more engaged now than we were last year.
The trick is staying that way. We need to do it.
Don't think your Dem member of Congress is going to go on automatic and be a hero without you, and don't think your Republican member of Congress doesn't hear you, and isn't growing concerned about the sustained engagement.
There is a bigger reason to stay engaged:?we have seen what happens when people?in a democracy lose?touch with their?civic responsibilities, because it happened to us.?Right now, we have to work hard?to catch up on and rebuild our
[liberal democratic](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/l/Liberal_democracy.htm)
institutions and principles. This will take at least a few election cycles. And then?we have to make a habit of dedicating some regular portion of our lives to tending?those institutions unfailingly.?Our country's problems?go far deeper than the elected person in the White House, but I do believe, with a great many of us working together, the solution is in our hands.

,"Good evening!
It's working...
[Jeff Sessions has recused himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html?_r=0)
from any investigation related to Russia's involvement with the Trump campaign or presidency. Jeff Sessions is the Attorney General and one of Trump's earliest and most loyal political supporters, so one would hope this will aid the possibility of a thorough and honest?investigation into this Russia mess.
...so let's keep going
While Trump's administration seems to be destined to come?crashing down in a spectacular?avalanche we can only hope doesn't crush all of us, Congress marches on passing horrible, horrible bills. Let's call about one of those bills today: the effort to
[defund Planned Parenthood](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-27/abortion-spat-imperils-gop-obamacare-repeal-and-risks-shutdown)
as part of the?ACA replacement?using an action called
[reconciliation](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122816822)
, which means?only a simple majority is needed to pass it?it cannot be filibustered.
Planned Parenthood
[provides essential health care](http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/misconceptions-about-planned-parenthood.html)
such as cancer screenings and?preventative care?to?2.5 million patients a year, mostly people of color, people with low incomes, and people in rural areas. Its?services include but aren't limited to family?planning and education, birth control, and reproductive health services. Some Planned Parenthoods provide abortion services though not all do.?Please take a moment and read
[January 15's?letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-jan-15-2017)
to reflect on?how family planning has benefitted you, your family, and your community,?and to?consider why abortion services are an essential choice to have accessible to people.
Men, you too. Men, have women's backs please. Men, be vocal?allies. Men, it (often)?takes two to make a baby. Men, you want healthy women and children in your life and in your society.
Your task
Call your elected officials and say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I am calling to tell _____ to vote NO on any attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. These attacks on this health service are unwarranted and seem weirdly obsessive. Taking away people's access to health care and family planning?is cruel, and sick people and families are a burden on the economy and on taxpayers. Paul Ryan's plan is a terrible idea that will hurt, not help, your constituents.
If you know your elected officials are pro-choice, say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I am calling to tell _____ to keep fighting to protect health care and choice by supporting
Planned Parenthood
. These attacks on this health service are unwarranted and seem weirdly obsessive
.
I am asking ______ to please make the case to his/her colleagues that Planned Parenthood offers essential services that help their constituents.
Wait, you're not done! Then call your
[GOVERNOR](https://www.usa.gov/state-governor)
and say:
My name is ______ and I live in _______. I am calling to ask what Governor ______ plans to do protect access to health care and reproductive health services should Congress defund Planned Parenthood.?Having sick people and?reducing access to essential services is more expensive for taxpayers, not less.
What measures are you taking to ensure people and families?receive the care they need and that taxpayers don't get caught in the middle?
I would be very interested in learning the answer to this. Please contact me at [phone] or [email] and let me know the answer. Thank you.
Please leave messages?since it's evening. If a voicemail is full, please make that?call tomorrow morning.
THANK YOU FIVE MINUTESERS!

,"Good morning!
It's working...
People are gathering once a week throughout the country to protest in front of their elected officials' offices, especially those who won't hold town halls. Until our elected officials conduct themselves sensibly?listen to their constituents,?acknowledge that Trump is a con man, and, start making policy that will
help
people and not hurt them, this?is what will happen. The movement is staying strong.
[This is what democracy looks like](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/rubio-is-asked-to-leave-tampa-office-over-disruption-from-weekly-protests/2314829)
.
I'll add that Trump voters are among those constituents that need to be listened to. If more people had been listened to, if policies hadn't been passed for the past 25 years, mostly but not exclusively by Republicans, that have caused economic struggle and closed off opportunity,?we would not have a president trump.
...so let's keep going
So Jeff Sessions had two conversations with the Russian ambassador?to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak,?in 2016, while Sessions was already serving as an official Trump supporter and surrogate, and Sessions didn't disclose this when he was asked about it in a couple different ways during his Attorney General confirmation hearings. He says he spoke with the Russian ambassador?in his capacity as a member of?the Armed Services?committee, not as a Trump stumper; however, the
[Washington?Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html)
asked all 26 other members if they spoke to Kislyak during that time and of the 20 who answered, all said No.
Some top Dems are
[calling for Sessions to resign](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/02/politics/democrats-sessions-russia-resignation-call/)
. I think that is?unwarranted?and likely?to backfire?at this point; it appears purely partisan. However, he is at the very least?unfit to be involved with any?investigation about communications between the Trump campaign and the?Russian government. If it turns out that he had a larger and unethical or illegal role or willfully lied,?that will emerge during further investigation and at that time resignation could be demanded.
I almost hesitate to return to this item since meanwhile Congress is passing awful awful bills left and right and Trump is signing stupid reactionary executive orders, but the timing seems important on this one?call today.
Your task
Call your representative, your senators, and Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell (phone numbers below). That's five people; it should still take you only five minutes. Demand an independent nonpartisan commission (
[not just ""an investigation""](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/17/14635966/congress-russia-putin-trump)
) to look into ties between candidate/president trump and Russia, and demand that Sessions recuse himself.
You still have those postcards I asked you to buy, riiiight? You can get 'em, pre-stamped, for like 53 cents at the post office!?If you can't get through, write them a postcard. Problem with their webform is yours will be dumped unless you live in Wisconsin (Ryan) or Kentucky (McConnell), though Ryan does have a Speaker of the House office webform you can use (below).?You could also tweet.
Say for your elected officials:
My name is ______ and my zip code is ______. I am calling to say it has become clear that an
independent nonpartisan commission
must
investigate ties between candidate Trump and the Russian government, and that?Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from any part of that investigation. Based on Sessions' communication with the Russian ambassador in 2016, when?he was also a strong supporter and surrogate for candidate Donald Trump, it is clear that his participation would obstruct the process and its effectiveness. Thank you.
My name is _______ and I'm calling Paul Ryan/Mitch McConnell in his capacity as Speaker of the House/Senate Majority Leader.
I am calling to say it has become clear that an
independent nonpartisan commission
must
investigate ties between candidate Trump and the Russian government, and that?Jeff Sessions
must
recuse himself from any part of that investigation. It is more?clear than ever that
independence
is needed? and that?Sessions' participation?would obstruct that independence. Thank you.
[If asked if you are a constituent: As Speaker of the House/Senate Leader, Ryan/McConnell has a responsibility to more than his home constituency. If he didn't want that, he shouldn't have taken on the role. I am an American and I am extremely worried [for my children and my family]?about our nation's sovereignty and safety and about the number and degree of lies and lack of transparency happening. Ryan/McConnell is in a position to do something about that.

Arizona was one of several states whose legislatures are aiming?to make participating in a march or rally subject to felony charges. Yes, now our states are making the right to assemble a serious crime. But, because of pressure from people like you, the Arizona Speaker of the House has

...so let's keep going
Let's turn our attention today to acts of hate and ignorance?happening all over the country and our president's manipulation of those acts.
Last night in his speech?Trump used the death of a Navy SEAL during a raid in Yemen?and the grief of that soldier's wife, to...rationalize? distract from? his horrifying policies and unpresidential conduct. For example, his ordering the?raid in the first place,
[hastily and without sufficient reason](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/yemen-seal-raid-yielded-no-significant-intelligence-say-officials-n726451)
. And his
[blaming everyone but himself](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-botched-yemen-raid-revisited/)
earlier that very same day?for how botched the raid was. And his grudging, belated acknowledgment of
[bomb threats, cemetery?desecrations](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/us/bomb-threats-jewish-centers-jcc/index.html)
, and
[outright murders](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/28/suspect-in-kansas-bar-shooting-of-indians-apparently-thought-they-were-iranians/?utm_term=.fece8a8d957e)
that clearly?targeted?the groups of people that Trump himself has targeted in rhetoric and action.?And?his policy of
[publishing weekly reports of immigrants](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/trump-scapegoats-unauthorized-immigrants-for-crime/518238/)
(documented and not) who have committed crimes; this is as senseless as publishing reports of people whose names begin with K who have published crimes, and that example helps make clear the purpose of such a list?to provoke fear and hatred toward the targeted group.

Your task
Write a letter to the editor of your local paper, post a comment on your local media's?Facebook, or tweet media reminding people of some or all of the above. Here are some samples:
I am extremely disturbed by the tactics Trump is using to provoke irrational fear and distaste for immigrants. For example, his decision to publish a weekly report of immigrants who have committed crimes i
s as senseless as publishing a report of people whose names begin with K who have committed crimes.
There is no evidence whatsoever that immigrants commit more crimes or are a danger in any way; in fact, research shows immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born people. This tactic mirrors a report published in Nazi Germany called
Der St?rmer
, which?showcased crimes allegedly committed by Jews.?This kind of move is clearly meant to stoke fear and anger against a targeted group. Trump then?doubled down on this idea Tuesday night?by parading the relatives of people killed?by immigrants at his speech.?This is bigotry-baiting in its purest form.?These actions do not reflect American values and?cannot stand.
OR
I am extremely disturbed by the tactics Trump is using to provoke irrational fear and distaste for immigrants.
For example, recent detainments and deportations from airports show an aggressive but capricious and ignorant policy. A children's book author from Australia and a French professor were recently detained and nearly sent home. A Nigerian man was forced to prove he knew coding language to support his claim that he was a software engineer; Muhammed Ali's son was detained and questioned?aggressively about his religion and beliefs.
These actions do not reflect American values and?cannot stand.
OR
I am extremely disturbed by the tactics Trump is using to provoke irrational fear and distaste for immigrants.?For example, his vastly expanded deportation policy has swept up numerous people, including legal residents and citizens, to the benefit of no one at all. There is already a
[gigantic slump in tourism](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-01/donald-trump-slump-could-hurt-us-tourism-industry/8313378)
to the U.S. because of his policies, and naturally these policies will have a chilling effect on immigration of any kind. Who among us does not know a Muslim doctor or restaurant manager, a Latino engineer?or mechanic? This is America. These people, our neighbors, our schoomates, our coworkers, are America.?Make no mistake, Trump's policies are a type of ethnic cleansing.
Tweets:
@[media outlet],
@realDonaldTrump uses #propaganda and fear-mongering just as every demagogue before him. His target: #immigrants.
@[media outlet],
#immigrants commit fewer crimes than native pop. @realDonaldTrump singling them out is race-baiting in its purest form.
@[media outlet],?100 #bombthreats, murderers shouting ""get out of my country;"" these are @realDonaldTrump's words and actions at work.
THANK YOU FIVE-MINUTESERS. Please write. Make it clear that xenophobic race-baiting and hate-mongering will not stand.

I?m calling to thank Representative _________ for co-sponsoring House Resolution 111.

Can I also count on ______ to go further by?committing to publicly call?for further congressional investigation into Trump?s corruption?
If your House rep is not a co-sponsor say:
My name is _______ and my zip code is ________. I am calling to ask if Representative _______ is planning to??co-sponsor?House Resolution 111.
[YES]?That?s great! If _______?truly believes, as I do, that Trump?s conflicts of interest are cause for concern, then (s)he should definitely do everything possible to make sure Congress fully investigates potential corruption. This means co-sponsoring bills like House Resolution 111?and making public statements supporting them.
Can you take down my information and let me know when (s)he has co-sponsored and issued a statement?
[NO]?That?s terrible. What that means is _______ is fine with letting Trump use the Oval Office to enrich himself and his family and fine with possible bribery from foreign governments, like Russia.
These conflicts of interest and entanglements are putting the very
safety and sovereignty

I hope ______ will reconsider his/her position and co-sponsor House Resolution 111.
[I DON'T KNOW/I'LL PASS ON YOUR CONCERNS]?That?s disappointing. I am very concerned?that
Trump might be?using?the Oval Office to enrich himself and his family and putting the interests of?foreign governments before our own.
These potential conflicts of interest and entanglements are putting the very
safety and sovereignty?of the United States in jeopardy, and the resolution would allow House members to properly investigate.?I hope ______ will?co-sponsor House Resolution 111. Please take down my information and let me know when (s)he has taken a position.
You can tweet, too:
@[house rep], pls co-sponsor @RepJerryNadler HR 111.
#Conflictsofinterest must be investigated. Democracy, security are at stake.
@[house rep],
thanks for co-sponsoring @RepJerryNadler HR 111. #Conflictsofinterest must be investigated. Democracy, security are at stake.
Note:
Last week we asked for an independent bipartisan commission. I *think* these requests don't conflict, because what this resolution would do is oblige Jeff Sessions to allow the House to look at all non-classified documents pertaining to various potential conflicts of interest, and that investigation could take various forms.?But?I will try to confirm this/provide further explanation.
THANK YOU, FIVE-MINUTESERS!

My U.S. House Rep is great with people issues, especially immigrants,?but doesn't much talk about the environment. I've called him about this, written,?held signs?(nice ones).?Yesterday I called his office to see if they had suggestions for
[yesterday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-24-2017)
and they told me about an upcoming townhall, and some immigration?workshops they were putting on...and a workshop?coming up about energy and the environment. I'm not saying it was ME who convinced him, but he's obviously getting enough calls asking about the environment that he put this on his agenda. Communicating works! I thanked her and told her this issue was important to me and I was so glad to hear about the workshop. Luis Gutierrez, ladies and gentlemen. Doing?his?job.

In December, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said
[of course Trump wouldn't ban media from press briefings; only dictators do that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/24/in-december-spicer-said-barring-media-access-is-what-a-dictatorship-does-today-he-barred-media-access/?utm_term=.7dbe6a91d000)
.?Yesterday,
[Trump banned?key?media?from a press briefing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/media-blocked-white-house-briefing-sean-spicer)
. Trump allowed media he perceived as friendly to attend and barred those he perceived as unfriendly. Breitbart,*?Washington Times, and two other right-wing media sites were allowed in, as well as ABC,?CBS, and NBC,?Time,?the Associated?Press, and the Wall Street Journal. The New York Times, CNN, Buzzfeed, LA Times, Politico, and foreign media?were told they were not on ""the list"" and were barred from entry. (There has never been a list before).
This is an authoritarian administration. In the United States, in our Constitutional democracy, the president does not repeat inflammatory lies and then?banish those who force him to contemplate his own actions. By the way, Trump today said he wouldn't attend the Correspondents' Dinner. So he's a chicken as well as a tyrant.
Two outlets, Time and AP, refused to enter in solidarity with those banned. Wall Street Journal says today it totally would?have refused if it had only known of the ban. Hmm. The networks went in.

I am extremely disappointed you chose to attend the ""invitation only"" press briefing.

I hope you consider your roles and responsibilities differently in the future. We are counting on you, and if you are not going to stand up to authoritarianism, you are enabling?it.

,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
The DNC seems to have no choice but to?be
[decidedly more progressive](http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/02/21/the-2017-dnc-chair-election-a-cheat-sheet/)
and take some decidedly different steps in their platform, tactics, and election for a new chair, given the pressure from below. And, as Howard Dean said in an interview today on the radio that I can't find online to link to, darnit,?if they dig their heels in against change, our nation full of newly formed?dynamic and organized progressive groups is?going to act anyway.
...so let's keep going
[Trump's immigration plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/us/politics/dhs-immigration-trump.html?_r=0)
works within the rules already set up, but takes advantage of areas of interpretation to be
[far more sweeping and?far less discerning](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/us/trump-immigration-policies-deportation.html)
than previous administrations' plans,?and to frankly attack basic human rights.
For example, p
eople may be apprehended and?deported without trial throughout the country; previously people already living in the country (as opposed to found on the border)?were entitled to a trial. Local law enforcement is obliged to enforce?immigration law; imagine the effect on law and order in your city if people are afraid to call the police, go to the hospital,?call 911, and so on. Most chilling to me,
Trump?claims he is going after criminals (which is no change in wording from Obama's policy), but that definition has been widened to include people who are convicted, charged, or
suspected
of a crime?that last could be anyone, couldn't it? On what grounds are you ""suspected"" of a crime??and the plan also includes prioritizing deporting people who have ""abused any program related to public benefits,"" which first of all calls up this?racist ""welfare queen"" type?trope, and also is very disturbingly vague. I have like forty cents on my library card, for example.
If you need more?evidence that the Bad Hombres?boogyman?is total, despicable bunk: it's long been documented that
[immigrants commit fewer crimes](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-6305.html)
than citizens, and many employers and entire?industries in the U.S.
[rely on undocumented laborers](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-undocumented-workers-industry-impact-0115-biz-20170113-story.html)
who also
[improve our economy](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/203984-illegal-immigrants-benefit-the-us-economy)
. (The ethics of this workforce situation are problematic; I note it?here to point out the stupidity and hypocrisy of Trumpist actions.)
Your task(s)
OK! Today. A few different tasks to choose from or, heck, do all:
1) If you are part of a faith community, please consider working with other interested congregants and/or your director to determine how you can become a part of the network of organizations of all faiths around the country providing comfort, care, advice, and advocacy for immigrants. Every religion speaks of caring for the stranger, and caring for all who seek comfort.
2) Call your elected officials. I know it's a lot, but please do?try to call your STATE elected officials as well: your state senator, state rep, and governor.
Say:
My name is _______ and my zip code is _________.?I am calling to say I oppose the Trump administration's plan regarding?undocumented people. His claims that he is focusing on criminals is false. His methods are cruel. His goals will not help the U.S. economy nor Americans'?safety or opportunity. I'd like ______ to please find ways to oppose this policy [at the state level]. I'd also like ______ to please?work hard with his/her colleagues?to [create a better alternative/create a?stance for the state that is respectful, compassionate,?and productive].
[If your elected official is friendly to this message, add:] Do you have any upcoming workshops and townhalls regarding this subject? Might you be adding such workshops in the future?
Call your mayor or community elected-official (in Chicago we have aldermen). Say:
I am calling to say I support our being a sanctuary city/I would like our city to be a sanctuary city. [Can I count on you to support efforts to become one??Our law enforcement already has a job to do, and making people fearful of calling the police or getting help in an emergency?will definitely not help our city.]
In social media, and/or in an email to your elected representatives,?tell your own family's story. Almost all?of us living here?are?immigrants. We have all been?called dangerous, lazy, and unAmerican when we first arrived?(perhaps we still are). Yet?we, our folks, persisted and raised proud Americans.?You can connect today's news to how your family was treated, and ask others to honestly take a look at themselves and do the same.
About the action asking for an independent bipartisan commission in re Trump & Russia
Subscriber Emily asked me why it's important to ask for a commission instead of an investigation when we are asking our representatives to push on the Russia/Trump connections (
[this letter here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-21-2017)
). The reason is there are several ways Congress can investigate, as
[this great Vox article](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/17/14635966/congress-russia-putin-trump)
outlines.
Right now the
standing committees
(e.g.,?the Senate Judicial Committee, Senate Intelligence, House Ways and Means, House Oversight)?are all controlled by Republicans since they control both Houses,?and it is unlikely they would seriously investigate the issue?they could say they had an investigation, say there's nothing there, and then close the books. Each of
those committees
also have a lot of other things on their plate?so they are also not going to be dedicated to one issue no matter which party controls the committee.
A
bipartisan select committee
ensures that the investigation?is not controlled by Republicans and that the people on the committee are only focusing on the one issue. And an
independent commission
is an even longer-term thing where they do deep investigative research and then come up with recommendations, like they did after 9/11. So while it's good to keep asking for an investigation generally, asking for a bipartisan independent commission is better and?establishes that the?stakes are high and we don't want to just be appeased and move on.
After that step there's an
independent investigator
, but that's led by the executive branch and appointed by the attorney general, um, Jeff Sessions, so...No. He's a huge Trump backer and has been from the start and that will not be independent or reliable.
OKAY THANK YOU FOR READING, FIVE MINUTESERS;?NOW GO FORTH AND ACT! :)

...so let's keep going
The
[Republicans' plan to replace?the ACA](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/affordable-care-act-congress.html?_r=0)
outlines 1)?eliminating the Medicaid expansion, which covers 10 million people, in favor of?block grants to states; 2) separating ""high-risk"" patients (patients that have, have had, or are at risk of getting seriously ill)?from others and putting them in their own insurance and coverage pool; and 3)?replacing?subsidies with health-care savings accounts. These are all awful ideas.
Block grants: Is your state in good financial shape? My state is not in good financial shape. Even in the best prepared?states, somebody?bears the brunt of any dysfunction/shortfall, and it's almost always?the most vulnerable. C
hildren,
people with disabilities, busy working families, and anyone unlucky enough to have happen to them the kinds of things that happen to living things, such as illnesses and injuries,?will lose out.
All states?will need to do?a lot more with a lot less. There are also
[Medicare changes](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/medicare-beneficiaries-pay-attention-repeal-replace-debate/)
associated with the GOP plan that?will result in less?coverage, fewer tests and drugs covered, and greater costs for recipients and taxpayers. There is no?plan for how people insured under the current Medicaid/Medicare ACA plan will be covered and there is no meaningful plan for financing the suggested changes.
High-risk pools:
[This has been tried before and has been miserable](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/18/514991567/gop-leaders-urge-return-to-high-risk-insurance-pools-that-critics-call-costly)
. Put all the people who need the greatest amount of care in one insurance pool and have them alone cover it through their insurance payments? What could go wrong? It's extremely expensive both for the insured and the state (that's you, the taxpayers).
This?could be any of us. Any of us could get cancer or pancreatitis?or ms. Any of us could get into a car?accident. Any of us could a newborn in the NICU.
Using health-care savings accounts doesn't work for people who have very little left over to save. Someone making $200,000 a year can put a hell of a lot more into their savings account than someone making $30,000 a year. Think about how that changes your decisions about when and how to seek care, and how those decisions then ripple down through your life.
Your task
Three calls today, your house rep and your two senators.*?You should already have all these numbers in your phone...if you don't
[put em in right now!](https://www.govtrack.us)
Say:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _______. I am calling to say I oppose the plan Paul Ryan outlined last week to replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). It does not adequately show how it would maintain coverage for people, where the money it needs?would come from, nor how much the transition itself would cost. The solutions he outlined are inadequate for covering people with serious conditions, busy families spinning a lot of plates, and many others.?I am calling to demand that the ACA be retained and strengthened or, if Congress wants to replace it, go for something based on a

My name is ______ and my zip code is _______. I am asking ________ to vote No on HR785 and HR744. These bills hurt the laborers and other working people Trump says he wants to help.
If you are writing or if you want to expound, add: The time that people think of when they say America was ""great"" was the decades after World War II?the heyday of unions. Unions allowed people the opportunity to provide for both their families and their health, and to therefore feel safe, confident, and optimistic while they built the economy.
Unions, plus free college for GIs, were largely responsible for our strong prospering middle class when the country was ""great."" To make the country great [again], vote NO on HR785 and?HR744.
Sample tweet:
@[your rep]#Unions are what made America great. HR785 and 744 hurt the workers Trump claims he wants to help. Vote NO.
King has introduced this in the past and GovTrack thinks it's unlikely it will pass?but I mean it's within the realm of possibility that we could say goodbye to the EPA and Roe v Wade (I think, largely due to DeVos' lack of experience, the Ed Dept. is safe, but I could be wrong), so who knows. And, as I sit here in Illinois, surrounded by previously blue, union-strong states that are now right-to-work and red...we've seen how it happens. It seems best to take precautions.
THANK YOU, FIVE MINUTESERS!
*If you live in Illinois, Indivisible Chicago is an excellent source for state-level actions.

,"Good evening!
SO SORRY for the very late letter today. Work obligations unfolded on their schedule today, not mine, and then there was an unexpected visit to the vet (all's well). At some point, life was going to happen in lieu of a timely letter, and we reached that point today.
It's working...
There are progressive groups and actions everywhere! Just look at all the
[actions?happening this month](http://www.resistancecalendar.org)
!?(For a nice visual, select ""monthly"" on the right-hand side.)
...so let's keep going
Tonight, ask your elected officials to
[push for an investigation on the appearance of collusion](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/senate-democrats-meeting-trump-russia-235036)
between Russian officials and the Trump campaign and administration. If you get pushback that this has not been determined?well, yeah, that's why we need an investigation.
Your task
Please call your elected officials now and leave a message. If the box is full please do this tomorrow morning, with my apologies for the late arrival of this letter.
My name is ________ and my zip code is _______. I am calling to say I support an independent nonpartisan commission to investigate communications between Donald Trump?s associates and Russian intelligence agents.?This is a matter of our nation's security and our democracy's integrity. Thank you.
You can also tweet or Facebook your elected officials a similar message.?It's important to ask for an
independent, nonpartisan
(or bipartisan)
commission
?not just an investigation. For example:
@[Rep's Twitter Handle] I support an indep. nonpartisan commission on Trump associates/Russian agents. I value our democracy's security, integrity.
THANK YOU, FIVE MINUTESERS!

It's working...
Efforts to repeal the ACA are slowing down, because...duh!
[No one wants their health care taken away!](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/affordable-care-act-critics.html?mwrsm=Facebook&_r=0)
Of course people want it improved, and Republicans are sweating trying to find a way to do that that doesn't anger insurers, pharmaceutical companies and other beneficiaries of the current system. Good luck, guys.
...so let's keep going
It's President's Day, and there are
[""Not My President"" actions](https://www.resistancecalendar.org)
all over the country. If you can and are so moved,
[find an event](https://www.resistancecalendar.org)
and go to it.
The way I see it, though,?making today about Trump strikes me as?a wasted opportunity.?President's Day is about honoring great presidents who have made our country better. Our current president?takes up way too much of my brainspace?already and elected officials' offices are closed today, so my task for you today is to?do something refreshingly affirmative.
Your task
Think about what makes a great president. Make a list. Think about what each of those things looks like.
What does integrity look like? What does judgment look like? What does compassion look like? What does equanimity under pressure look like? What does intelligence look like? What does strategy in the service of the country look like? What does humility look like? What does vision look like??What does wisdom look like? What does goodness look like?
Choose a few words and?phrases, and then write a letter and send it to
[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact#page)
,
[Pence](https://www.facebook.com/GovernorMikePence/)
,
[McConnell](https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contactform)
, Paul
[Ryan](http://www.speaker.gov/contact)
, and your elected representatives. And maybe your local paper. And?post it on social media. Let's get people thinking ahead to what we want. Because can you think of any Democrat who could win a Presidential race right now??I can't. We need to start envisioning leaders, paying attention?to who rises up, and cultivating them.
Dear __________:
Today is President's Day. On this day, we honor our best presidents. I am writing to remind you what a great leader looks like.
The president?I want has integrity.?The president I want has judgment[...etc. Use my list above or write your own.]
Please re-focus yourself on what makes a good leader, and demand it of yourself, your colleagues, and our democracy.
Sincerely,
[if you have more than five minutes, add a paragraph like this one before that last sentence and the sign-off:]?A great president says what s/he means, means what s/he says, and?puts?the well-being of the American people first.?A great president makes tough decisions when needed, but never forsakes thorough vetting, honesty,?and compassion in doing so.?A great president sees opportunity in change?and plans carefully to ensure people are prepared for such challenges. A great president believes in the common good.?A great president?sees strength and vibrancy?in our diverse society?and learns from the mistakes we make in managing that diversity.?A great president sees unfairness and calls it out when s/he sees it.?A great president is sure-footed enough to confidently confront a bully but light-footed enough to use only the very?strength or strategy needed. A great president recognizes his or her power and has the humility and?wisdom to channel it through service. A great president is capable of walking in another person's shoes, and does so, regularly.
[add a paragraph like this for an even longer version:] Since our current president holds none of these characteristics, I prefer to think about someone who does. [Write about a president you admire, or different components of different presidents you admire, or heck, write about someone in your own life with these qualities.]

?It's working....
Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, Trump's pick for replacing Michael Flynn as national security adviser, declined the honor. He publicly cited polite reasons, but privately called the administration an inflexible and chaotic ""

.""
Of course Trump is largely responsible for this reputation all by himself, but the constant pushback on the part of the public and (at our insistence) Congressional Democrats certainly helps.
So let's keep going
Have you heard of
[Countable](https://www.countable.us)
? It's an app that tells you at a glance what Congress is voting on and?what your elected officials are voting. It's great, but I have to tell you that it's not for the faint of heart these days. It feels like everything that is dear is being demolished.

It's demoralizing. I'm not gonna lie. It's hard to take.
But it's important to take the long view.
The long view includes 2018 and 2020. So we need to preserve our union and our voting rights until then, and then get these awful people?out of office.

Right now, as far as I understand, Swing Left is?focusing on US districts (not state level); often Flippable does, too, though this race in Delaware is a state one.?I say ""right now"" because a lot of these groups are growing and changing by the minute, with so many newly minted activists trying to figure out where they fit.

Okay!
Here's the original letter from today, minus Task 1.
It's working...
Restaurants and other
[businesses all over the country closed](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/16/a-day-without-immigrants-strike/97965460/)
in support of A Day Without Immigrants, choosing to lose thousands of dollars in order to stand in solidarity with their immigrant employees and show others how vital immigrants are to our nation's economy, culture, and very existence.
Next week elected representatives are expected to be in their home districts and
[many are avoiding meetings and town halls](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washingtons-gop-members-of-congress-under-pressure-to-face-their-voters/)
. This isn't good, of course, but it shows they are really feeling the heat. And well they should.
...so let's keep going
Next week, Congress has a ""state work period,"" which means your elected officials will be at their home offices. If at all possible, go down to see them in person. At this point, you might not be able to actually get in to sit in their offices and see them, but you can show up outside and/or you can go to a town hall.
Your task today is to arm?yourself with information,
whether you have time to do more next week or not.
[Here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources-2/2017/2/11/town-hall-tips-fact-sheet?link_id=4&can_id=8f9891ddae34cf619c28ce36c23ca57f&source=email-reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_referrer=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_subject=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible)
and
[here](http://preview.mailerlite.com/k7z3v4/563672799336468542/i0b1/)
are
some excellent information resources on town halls, and
[here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources-2/2017/2/12/missing-members-of-congress-action-plan?link_id=5&can_id=8f9891ddae34cf619c28ce36c23ca57f&source=email-reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_referrer=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_subject=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible)
is information on what to do if your member of Congress shirks his/her responsibility to hold town halls and meet with constituents.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq1NT9DZ2z3B8ixhid894e77u9rN5XIgOwWtTW72IYA/htmlview?sle=true)
and
[here](http://heritageaction.com/2017/02/town-hall-list/)
are lists of town halls scheduled (so far--keep checking the Google Doc especially for updates). On a slightly different note
[here](http://actionforabettertomorrow.org/blog/2017/2/13/action-request-a-meeting-with-your-representative-senators)
is some great info on asking for a constituent meeting (one-on-one or a small group meeting).
For the town halls or demonstrations, you don't have to go it alone?connect?up with
[a local Indivisible Guide group](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/show-up)
or issues-oriented group such as?Sierra Club or an immigrants' rights group. I know
[Planned Parenthood](http://plannedparenthoodevents.ngpvanhost.com/)
has a handy tool for finding supporters near you who are planning?to see your legislator?other groups?might as well.
Your goal for this action is to make sure you know whether your reps have a town hall planned for next week and where/when you can show up en masse in front of their office (or actually talk to them!). Again?even if you can't actually go next week, knowledge is still power, plus you could pass the info onto friends or post it in social media.
Tactics
Subscriber Zabrina wrote me to ask
why we are not laser-focused
on
[the Russia thing](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/16/515624391/nobody-that-i-know-of-trump-denies-campaign-contacts-with-russia)
as an impeachable offense. It's a good question, and I thought others might be interested. My answer is two-fold?why not focus on the Russia collusion allegations, and why not demand impeachment.
I have made a conscious choice not to focus on any one issue exclusively, partly?because different things feel alarming and urgent to different people for different reasons, but mainly because a big part of our awful challenge right now is that Trump is not the only problem. A virulently right-wing strain of Republicans has unfettered control right now of the House and Congress, two-thirds of the states' governorships, and a good number of both branches of state assemblies as well, and they will remain after Trump is gone. There are no checks on them, and these are not Eisenhower or, shoot, even Nixon Republicans. While we are all focused on the latest Trump craziness, Congress is passing horrible horrible stuff left and right. Well, more like right and righter.
So we have this super dangerously unpredictable and ignorant clown to contend with, and then we also have these super power-hungry party-over-country zealots who in some ways are worse because they are far more organized and smart and they know how our system works and how to manipulate it. And we MUST weaken the control and power of that right-wing juggernaut while also trying not to have Trump get us killed. So I am loathe to focus exclusively on one egregious new development at the cost of letting other horrible things go uncommented on.
We must be PREPARED for 2018 and 2020, and if we think Trump being gone is all we need, the right wing will maintain or expand its control.
As for demanding impeachment...there is plenty to investigate under impeachment charges, for sure, but it also looks like he's tangling himself up pretty bad in his own rope, and I think the more he does to weaken his own self, and the more losses he suffers, the more he undermines his own legitimacy, the more death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts people like you and me (and, at our insistence, Democratic elected officials) are causing by resisting every thing, the more amateurish and bungling his advisors look...the easier it will be to take him down when the time comes. I think we also want to not martyr him. He needs to lose legitimacy among his own supporters too. I keep thinking about the Supreme Court vote legalizing marriage equality; the lawyers had one chance to bring the issue to the Supreme Court so they wanted to make damned sure they had as solid a case as possible both in terms of legal argument and in terms of the mood of the country.
I hope this helps. Thanks for reading! And THANK YOU FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

took himself out of the running due to lack of support, and now EPA nominee
[Scott Pruitt](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/trumps-appointees-conflicts-of-interest-a-crib-sheet/512711/#Pruitt)
is potentially in trouble. Let's get this EPA-suing, pollution-loving, climate-change denying worst-possible-candidate outta there. A judge from Oklahoma (where Pruitt was attorney general) has
[ordered Pruitt to turn over thousands of documents](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-scott-pruitt-epa-emails-20170216-story.html)
related to his communications with coal, gas, and oil industry execs by Tuesday. Unfortunately, he might be confirmed today.
Call both of your Senators and say:
My name is ____ and I am a constituent. I am calling to say the Senate must not hold a confirmation vote on Scott Pruitt until Senator ____ and the rest of the Senators have had a chance to review the communications ordered turned over by that Oklahoma judge on Thursday. Pruitt has until Tuesday to turn over the documentation, so the hearing should be scheduled late next at week at earliest. These documents are entirely germane to the confirmation, since there are unresolved questions of conflict of interest related to them. I am asking Senator _____ to demand a delay in the Pruitt vote until late next week.
On a separate note, I also want to alert Senator ______ to my extreme concern about the
[communications alleged between Russian officials](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/16/515624391/nobody-that-i-know-of-trump-denies-campaign-contacts-with-russia)
and Trump campaign officials. Do you know when a bipartisan investigatory panel will be formed on this?
Task 2
Next week, Congress has a ""state work period,"" which means your elected officials will be at their home offices. If at all possible, go down to see them in person. At this point, you might not be able to actually get in to sit in their offices and see them, but you can show up outside and/or you can go to a town hall.
Your task today is to arm?yourself with information, whether you have time to do more next week or not.
[Here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources-2/2017/2/11/town-hall-tips-fact-sheet?link_id=4&can_id=8f9891ddae34cf619c28ce36c23ca57f&source=email-reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_referrer=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_subject=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible)
and
[here](http://preview.mailerlite.com/k7z3v4/563672799336468542/i0b1/)
are
some excellent information resources on town halls, and
[here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources-2/2017/2/12/missing-members-of-congress-action-plan?link_id=5&can_id=8f9891ddae34cf619c28ce36c23ca57f&source=email-reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_referrer=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible-7&email_subject=reclaim-recess-with-indivisible)
is information on what to do if your member of Congress shirks his/her responsibility to hold town halls and meet with constituents.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq1NT9DZ2z3B8ixhid894e77u9rN5XIgOwWtTW72IYA/htmlview?sle=true)
and
[here](http://heritageaction.com/2017/02/town-hall-list/)
are lists of town halls scheduled (so far--keep checking the Google Doc especially for updates). On a slightly different note
[here](http://actionforabettertomorrow.org/blog/2017/2/13/action-request-a-meeting-with-your-representative-senators)
is some great info on asking for a constituent meeting (one-on-one or a small group meeting).
For the town halls or demonstrations, you don't have to go it alone?connect?up with
[a local Indivisible Guide group](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/show-up)
or issues-oriented group such as?Sierra Club or an immigrants' rights group. I know
[Planned Parenthood](http://plannedparenthoodevents.ngpvanhost.com)
has a handy tool for finding supporters near you who are planning?to see your legislator?other groups?might as well.
Your goal for this action is to make sure you know whether your reps have a town hall planned for next week and where/when you can show up en masse in front of their office (or actually talk to them!). Again?even if you can't actually go next week, knowledge is still power, plus you could pass the info onto friends or post it in social media.
Tactics
Subscriber Zabrina wrote me to ask why we are not laser-focused on the Russia thing as an impeachable offense. It's a good question, and I thought others might be interested. My answer is two-fold?why not focus on the Russia collusion allegations, and why not demand impeachment.
I have made a conscious choice not to focus on any one issue exclusively, partly?because different things feel alarming and urgent to different people for different reasons, but mainly because a big part of our awful challenge right now is that Trump is not the only problem. A virulently right-wing strain of Republicans has unfettered control right now of the House and Congress, two-thirds of the states' governorships, and a good number of both branches of state assemblies as well, and they will remain after Trump is gone. There are no checks on them, and these are not Eisenhower or, shoot, even Nixon Republicans. While we are all focused on the latest Trump craziness, Congress is passing horrible horrible stuff left and right. Well, more like right and righter.
So we have this super dangerously unpredictable and ignorant clown to contend with, and then we also have these super power-hungry party-over-country zealots who in some ways are worse because they are far more organized and smart and they know how our system works and how to manipulate it. And we MUST weaken the control and power of that right-wing juggernaut while also trying not to have Trump get us killed. So I am loathe to focus exclusively on one egregious new development at the cost of letting other horrible things go uncommented on.
We must be PREPARED for 2018 and 2020, and if we think Trump being gone is all we need, the right wing will maintain or expand its control.
As for demanding impeachment...there is plenty to investigate under impeachment charges, for sure, but it also looks like he's tangling himself up pretty bad in his own rope, and I think the more he does to weaken his own self, and the more losses he suffers, the more he undermines his own legitimacy, the more death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts people like you and me (and, at our insistence, Democratic elected officials) are causing by resisting every thing, the more amateurish and bungling his advisors look...the easier it will be to take him down when the time comes. I think we also want to not martyr him. He needs to lose legitimacy among his own supporters too. I keep thinking about the Supreme Court vote legalizing marriage equality; the lawyers had one chance to bring the issue to the Supreme Court so they wanted to make damned sure they had as solid a case as possible both in terms of legal argument and in terms of the mood of the country.
I hope this helps. Thanks for reading! And THANK YOU FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

,"Good morning!
It's working...
[Andrew Puzder withdrew](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/andrew-puzder-withdrew-labor-secretary.html)
from consideration for Secretary of Labor. This is great news, as, like so many of Trump's other picks, he was a
[worst possible choice](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/us/politics/andrew-puzder-labor-secretary.html)
, hostile in every way to?the working-class people?that Trump claimed he would champion as president.
...so let's keep going
You have one call and one act of awareness to do today.
Please make the call immediately
, with my apologies for the late notice. They are up for a vote today.
Task 1
The House is voting on three bills meant to start the process of gutting the Endangered Species Act and other protections for the plants and animals that need us as much as we need them. We
are
in an eco
system
, y'all.
Say:
My name is _____ and my zip code is _____.?I am calling to tell ______ that I strongly oppose three bills up for a vote today:
[HR 424](https://secure.defenders.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=3145&s_src=3WDW1704JHTXX&s_subsrc=hr424)
,
[HR 717](http://thehill.com/opinion/letters/319758-congress-must-not-pass-endangered-species-reform-bill)
, and
[House Joint Resolution?69](https://secure.humanesociety.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=7313)
.
I expect Representative ______ to vote against these bills.
[More, if you wish to add it:]?There is no good reason?to weaken the Endangered Species Act, and this bill?relies on the uninformed opinions of people who know nothing about ecosystems or animals. We humans have taken over the planet and?we are now?responsible for the existence of the other plants and animals here, like it or not. We rely on plants and animals as much as they rely on us. As for the wolf bill?and the grizzly bear?bill, we have much more informed and less cruel ways of understanding and managing wildlife these days. We know better than these bills. I am asking ______ to oppose these bills.
[
More potential add-on?:?The Bible offers?plenty of ways to protect people and the earth, but?I don't come by using those arguments authentically. Maybe some of you can help me. Any feedback on the following?argument? Let me know, and use it if it speaks to you and/or your associates and elected officials.]
The Bible tells us we have dominion over animals. This means that
[it is our responsibility to protect?them](https://bible.org/article/christian-environmentalism)
. Dominion means stewardship, not destruction. Everything in the world is connected and we are playing with fire when we act with pride or greed?against that notion.
Task 2
A lot of restaurants and other businesses?are following D.C.'s lead in observing
[A?Day Without Immigrants](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/16/515555428/a-day-without-immigrants-promises-a-national-strike-thursday)
today. This is in response to Trump's call to build his wall?and other?nonsense words?and deeds?that are making our nation
[a hostile place for immigrants](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/trumps-orders-immigration-rattle-educators/)
and
[people perceived to be immigrants](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/us/trump-us-immigration-reaction/)
. Today,?offer understanding and support of?your local places that are closed or operating with a skeleton crew (e.g., if they are closed,?take a moment to write?on their Facebook page: ""Thank you for supporting your staff today, the Day Without Immigrants. We wouldn't be America if we didn't have immigrants""). Shop and eat today?at places that are?donating to immigration or anti-hate causes. If there's a march or demonstration in your area, consider attending for whatever amount of time you can. If you are an immigrant or a business owner, you can play?a larger role and strike, or support?your employees in?striking,?yourself.
THANK YOU, FIVE MINUTESERS!

[highly likely](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/republicans-want-flynn-investigations/)
. If you didn't get through yesterday, please call today?
[here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-14-2017)
's the information and scripts ?from yesterday's letter.
House Oversight Committee chair?Jason Chaffetz
[sent Trump a letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/15/1-afternoon-3-investigations-the-trump-white-house-is-off-to-an-inauspicious-start/?utm_term=.d23cd5e530c7)

[yesterday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-14-2017)
).
...so let's keep going
Just one call today, two subjects.
Unfortunately, the House Ways and Means committee
[declined the opportunity](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/news/economy/trump-tax-returns-kevin-brady/)
to request Trump's tax returns. The public has an interest in these tax returns and every president (and presidential candidate, and other prominent government figure) has released tax returns in the past. If your representative is
[on the Committee](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/subcommittee/full-committee/)
, don't skip this part of your?call.
Secondly, the House is poised to
[strike a rule that provides for health services](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/14/congress-challenge-rule-protecting-planned-parenthood-grants/97903856/)
for low-income women?using their damned
[Congressional Review Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/congressional-review-act-obama-regulations.html)
.
Men, we need your voices on this as much as we need women's voices, if not more. Call.
Your task
Call your representative.
Say:
My name is ____ and my zip code is _____. I?am calling for two reasons. First, I am disappointed that the House Ways and Means Committee has declined to request Trump's tax returns. Trump has said he won't release his taxes because Americans don't care, but we do. I want Representative ______ to?find a way to request his tax returns.
Secondly,?I am calling about the measure to repeal the Title X?rule. I?strongly oppose the use of the Congressional Review Act to dismantle this funding. [First of all, abortion. is. legal. and people should be able to make decisions about their health and reproductive capacities themselves. Moreover,] people rely on Title X?to access
[birth control, family planning resources, and preventative health care](https://www.istandwithpp.org/call/titlex/house)
. More than 4 million people received services in 2015 through more than 3,900 health centers funded under Title X of the Public Health Service Act?[link
[here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/14/congress-challenge-rule-protecting-planned-parenthood-grants/97903856/)
]. I am watching and I absolutely expect Representative ______ to oppose this irrational and damaging measure.
Keep the pressure on! THANK YOU, FIVE MINUTESERS!

Today, Sunday, get to something you didn't get to this week:
1) Help gray wolves stay non-extinct
[here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-6-2017)
. Please. They need you. The Endangered Species Act, which has rescued 99% of its more than 2000 listed animals from extinction and is on the chopping block, needs you.
2) Learn about your state reps, and why it's seriously important that you follow them,
[here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-9-2017)
.
3) Call or email your elected officials in support of bills examining Trumpist conflicts of interest

.
4) Set yourself up to learn about state-specific bills

[Tuesday's](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-7-2017)
action was mostly about Scott Pruitt and we'll revisit that this week.
A note: I've noticed that when you look at letters in the archive, the font varies. That's odd, and not graphically pleasing. Sorry about that. I wish I had control over it so I could fix it.

,"Good evening!
I named yesterday's letter Feb 11. I'm sure you all figured it out?much faster than I did (today's letter?almost went out as Feb. 12!).
It's working...
Remember
[Jan. 2's five-minute action](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-jan-2-2017)
to support public-school science teacher
[Cheryl Turpin](https://cherylturpinforvb.com)
in the Virginia Beach?special election Jan. 10? She lost?by 362?votes, the smallest margin in the district's history. Galvanized by the support, she?is now running for that?seat in the regular election in November. (
[Donate](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ct362)
if you like ? she is?suggesting $3.62 to symbolize the votes.)
So let's keep going...
[Thursday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-9-2017)
was about why
civic participation and activism on the?state level
is crucial.?So now you've signed up for
[your state assembly elected officials'](https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/)
newsletters and put their contact info in your phone, riiiiight?
Good! Now that you have the people to contact, how do you learn about state issues?
Turns out today's topic was an
extremely
difficult task to spell out. It's actually really really rilly
rilly
hard to give?people all over the country?general hints for learning about?state-level issues. Go figure.
Your task
Your five minute task today is to sign yourself up for one or more email lists.
I know this will be?annoying for a while; eblasts, money requests, blergh.
But bear with me. It's the best way for you to build your knowledge about your own state.
Here is that task (and beyond):
1.?Find your local
[Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/local-action-groups)
group?and your local
[Organizing for Action](https://www.ofa.us/get-involved/connect/)
group and?sign up?to get both their emails.*
If these groups are not very active in your area, figure out where?in?your state they are and sign up for that affiliate.??Even if you can't or don't want to make any of these groups' meetings, pay close attention to their meeting notes and action items related to?state?initiatives.
2. Notice which state issues concern or interest you the most. Contact your Indivisible and?OFA groups and ask them which local organizations are opposing?or supporting?certain bills.?You can then contact and follow those groups.
Make sure you find and sign up with the
local
affiliates of national groups?the local affiliates?are state?focused and action oriented in a way that the national groups?will not be.
For example, the local affiliates of the
[Sierra Club](http://www.sierraclub.org/near-you)
,
[Moms Demand Action/Everytown](http://act.everytown.org/signup/Join-Moms/?source=mdmo_MomsMain&utm_source=md_m_&utm_medium=_o&utm_campaign=MomsMain)
, and
[Showing Up for Racial Justice](http://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/affiliated_groups_local_contacts)
all direct viewers toward working on
state-level issues
.
From these groups,
even if you don't attend?meetings or events, you will learn?which bills are moving through your state and can?call?your state elected officials to oppose/support the bills.?If the organizations?offer
petitions, use those as a guide to call rather than as a substitute.
3.?Once you are paying attention, you will also become aware of local-local groups, not just the local affiliates of national groups. Parents' groups,?faith groups, and neighborhood groups, for example, often do amazing work and really have their ear to the ground about legislation coming up.?Once again, if you can?join or volunteer for those groups, great, but if not, that's fine?you can learn from them about important developments in your state and call your state elected officials.
For example, in Chicago the
[Community Renewal Society](http://www.communityrenewalsociety.org)
is a faith-based organization doing?amazing prisoners' rights/criminal justice reform stuff, among other things,?and
[Raise Your Hand Illinois](http://www.raiseyourhandaction.org)
is composed of a crew of kick-ass parents?fighting for public education.
4.?In the course of all this?you will likely learn which elected state officials champion the issues that are important to you. Even if they are not your elected official, start following them; their websites and?social media pages will be a great resource for learning about developments on those issues.
For example, in Illinois, Sara?Feigenholtz co-sponsored a bill to get rid of
[Illinois' ""trigger law,""](http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2016/12/12/illinois-lawmakers-look-expand-protect-abortion-rights)
passed in 1973,?which would make abortion immediately illegal should Roe fall. Sara?Feigenholtz is not my state rep, but she sure has my gratitude and my ear.
5. If you subscribe to a bunch of things to figure out what you're most interested in, at any point you can unburden yourself of all those emails by?unsubscribing to some?once you figure out what the best sources are for you.
New subscribers,?I promise you that the vast majority of actions really are just about five minutes. This five-step process situation?is?anomalous.
Fun with free civic-participation tools!
Subscriber Kari asked what Maxine Water's bill's number was (because her rep's?office asked her). It didn't say anywhere on Maxine Waters' link, but I went to
[govtrack.us](http://govtrack.us)
, clicked to browse bills, and then searched using her name in quotes and the word ""Russia."" The bill came up in the list of possibilities ?
[here's](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hconres15)
the direct link to what I found. So! It's good to be reminded?there are these amazing tools at our fingertips. Waters' bill?by the way?is House Congressional Resolution 15.

[Indivisible's freakin amazing guide](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources-3/)

THANK YOU FIVE MINUTESERS! STATE POLITICS?IT'S NOT JUST FOR WONKS ANYMORE!",2017-05-19 00:41:36.171243,,,"Your five-minute action item today: Feb. 11, 2017",Parsed https://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes for training data,Small Steps for a Big Impact,[],FiveMinutes,[],[],http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-11-2017-1
,"Good afternoon!
It's working...
[The Ninth Circuit rejected Trump's bid](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/politics/appeals-court-trump-travel-ban.html)
to reinstate his capricious and illegal executive order banning Muslims and refugees from entering the country.?This is just one?battle of a long?war?a?more airtight order could be created, Congress could create similar legislation, Trump could appeal?but it's a good win. Yay lawyers, law, and judiciary!
...so let's keep going
[Yesterday's letter](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-feb-9-2017)
made the case for the importance of state-level civic participation and activism. We'll return to that tomorrow. Today, let's make some calls.
The conflicts of interest of Trump and his administration staff?are
[many and ridiculous](https://corrupt.af)
,?so let's focus on a couple key ones.?These suggestions thanks to
[reactletter.com](https://www.reactletter.com)
. You can find the links supporting these actions?at their letter
[here](http://us14.campaign-archive2.com/?u=34bf9c62b5c76a26e2e6e912d&id=de26196d8a)
, though I also compulsively added most of them below.
Call
[your House Rep](https://www.govtrack.us)
Say:
I am extremely concerned about Donald Trump's continuing conflicts of interest.
I am asking Representative _____ to?support or, better yet, co-sponsor,
[Representative Waters? bill to investigate](https://waters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-waters-introduces-legislation-urging-investigation)
President Trump?s ties to Russia and cyberattacks.?Please also find a means to
[press for Donald Trump's taxes](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/07/news/economy/trump-tax-returns/)
to be released. I care a lot about his taxes and about the fact that he won't release them.
Call
[your Senators](https://www.govtrack.us)
:
Say:
I am extremely concerned about Donald Trump's continuing conflicts of interest. I am asking Senator _____ to please support the
[Russia Review Act](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/russia-sanctions-gop-senators-donald-trump/)
. Please also find a means to
[press for Donald Trump's taxes](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/07/news/economy/trump-tax-returns/)
to be released. I care a lot about his taxes and about the fact that he won't release them.
These people are co-sponsoring the Russia Review Act, so adjust your script accordingly by?thanking them and asking them to keep pushing if one is your Senator:
John McCain, R-AZ
Marco Rubio, R-FL
Sherrod Brown, D-OH
Claire McCaskill, D-MO
Ben Cardin, D-MD
Lindsey Graham, R-SC
These people have the power to request?tax?returns from the Secretary of Treasury as Chairs of Finance Committee/Joint Committee on Taxation/House Ways and Means Committee respectively, so push accordingly if you are from IA,?UT, or TX-8.
Sen Chuck Grassley,?R-IA
Sen?Orrin Hatch,?R-UT
House Rep, Kevin Brady
Quick bonus
Email the House Oversight Committee (
[oversight.house.gov/whistle/](https://oversight.house.gov/whistle/)
)
Copy and paste (and change as you wish) this:
I am extremely concerned about Donald Trump's continuing conflicts of interest. Please investigate all of the following:
1) Russia's inappropriate ties to our election process, and the possibility that Trump and his supporters knew of these ties;
2) Trump's inadequate-to-absent divestment?from?his business holdings, and the subsequent personal?wealth and influence?he has gained from entities here in the U.S. and all over the world?as a result;
3) Trump's refusal to release his taxes;
4) Trump's repeated threats?and?intimidation aimed at?individuals and corporations;
5) Trump's orders and actions intended?to circumvent our established system of checks and balances.
This committee is overseen by Jason Chaffetz,?who was gleefully smacking his lips at the years of investigations he had pre-lined up for Clinton but who has yet to agree to investigate anything Trump's done (though he finally squeaked out some concern about Kellyanne Conway's
[ethics-shattering plug for Ivanka merch](http://actionforabettertomorrow.org/blog/2017/2/9/action-kellyanne-conway-just-broke-the-law-on-live-tv)

and

,"Good morn...afternoon!
Oh,
[where to start](http://gph.is/1qO4hYT)
. We could go?the
[kleptocratic grabs](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interests/508382/)
route.?We could go the
[House dumping the Elections Commission](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-fears-fraud-gop-eliminates-election-commission-45328264)
route, the
[continuing horror show of cabinet appointees](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/trump-cabinet-tracker/510527/)
route,?the House bills to
[eliminate the EPA](http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-end-EPA-10910411.php)
[and the Dept. of Education](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/02/09/514148945/about-that-bill-abolishing-the-department-of-education)
(even if the sponsors?are just posturing, these actions reveal a dangerous contempt for our government by elected?members of our very same government), the
[environmental carnage](http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2017/02/change-administrations-puts-zion-national-park-bind-over-drilling-proposal)
route, the plan to take the pressure off white supremacists by
[revamping a U.S. counter-extremism program](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO)
...
I think we're going to go big picture today.
The fact is, Trump's?choices for cabinet make sense?to his advisors?and our Republican Congress: Bannon?has stated many times over that his goal is to
[literally destroy our country's structure](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/steve-bannon-will-lead-trumps-white-house)
and?we know today's
[right-wing thinking](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/charles-koch-wants-to-be-the-next-bernie-sanders.html)
mirrors?that of a high-school boy's thinking after getting his mind blown by
[Ayn Rand](https://newrepublic.com/article/69239/wealthcare-0)
. So absolutely this administration and this Republican Congress are going to work as fast as possible to dismantle agencies that exist to protect people and?the common good.
?
W
e don't have to wait to see how this turns out. We've
seen what places with no government?look like and
[it is pretty hellish](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/column-this-is-what-happens-when-you-take-ayn-rand-seriously/)
.
[Very hellish](http://www.cfr.org/fragile-or-failed-states/failed-states-world-terror/p4733)
. But here we are.
Even if Trump gets impeached or resigns, a?far right-wing apparatus remains and will gleefully?continue in this vein ? unefettered by Trump's stupid amateur illegal?mistakes, actually.
What this means is, a ton of things are going to be kicked down?to the states, regardless of whether they have the money or the will to manage them.
You MUST get involved with your state.
Your health, your?civil rights, your environment, your air and water, your reproductive agency, your criminal justice and policing system, your voting rights, your kids' education, your community's paths for immigrants and refugees ? protections and opportunities in these areas?WILL be decimated?with this administration and Congress.
You must make sure that not only your district?but the district next door and next door to that has progressive leadership
or is on the path toward progressive leadership in 2018 and 2020. You must ensure your governor's office has the interests of the people of your state in mind.?Blue-stater? Doesn't matter. There are lots of red districts in your deep-blue state led by tea-partiers who hate library bonds and public parks, I guarantee you.
This is a nationwide letter so I can't speak to a specific five-minute task?in your specific state. But I can point you to a couple steps so state-level tasks will find their way to you.
Your task today
is one of those steps:
Okay finally! Your task
Find out who your state senator and state house?representative are
[using openstates.org](https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/)
; then click on their names to
check out bills they've sponsored and recent votes
. Openstates.org is?pretty sweet (
[give them money](https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/open-states-general-support-fund)
if you are so moved).
Then go to your state officials'?websites to put their phone numbers into your phone
and sign up for their mailing list/newsletter
.?They need to know you care and you need to know what they are doing and not doing. While you're there, peruse their website and get familiar with how they present themselves and their issues of interest.
It's working
You know how Mitch McConnell silenced Elizabeth Warren?yesterday? His words,?""
[She was warned. She was given and explanation. Nevertheless,?she persisted](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/nevertheless-she-persisted-and-the-age-of-the-weaponized-meme/516012/)
"" perfectly summarize?every story about?women's struggle?for opportunity, equity, respect,?and safety throughout history, and now the?phrase has become a sort of joyful battlecry against the Trumpist Right. Next time you are feeling cowed by things, remember
[#ShePersisted](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23shepersisted&src=typd)
.
Also, the Democrats in Senate have been staying up all?night?and slowing down all day to willfully make?the confirmation processes as painful as possible ? because we asked them to. Shoot 'em a thank you message on social media.
OK! BYE! LOOK UP YOUR STATE REPS! THANK YOU!

,"Good morning!
[Betsy Devos was confirmed](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38875924)
to be Secretary of Education, which I find astonishing ?could one additional Republican not admit that she has no qualifications? ??and
[Jeff Sessions](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-jeff-sessions-civil-rights-drugs-20170120-story.html)
is set to be voted on today, Wednesday. Call each of your Senators. Then tweet McConnell about?his horrible behavior.
Task 1
For Democratic senators, say:
I am calling from zip code ______. I?want to thank Senator _____ for doing his/her part to
[make the confirmation process for both DeVos and Sessions?very challenging](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-democrats-plan-late-night-oppose-ag-nominee-sessions-n718066)
.?I am asking him/her to?continue?to?do everything possible to block Jeff Sessions' nomination.
For Republican senators except Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski:
I am calling from zip code ______.
I am extremely disappointed in Senator _____'s vote for Betsy Devos.?I would like a phone call or email back explaining?this mystifying support for a
[clearly unqualified person](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-betsy-devos-confirmation-debacle)
. My email?address/phone number is?_______. ?I am also calling to say I am strongly opposed to Jeff Sessions for Attorney General and I expect Senator _______ to vote No.
If your Senator is Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski:
I am calling from zip code ______. I?appreciate Senator ______ putting our country's families over her party by voting No on Betsy DeVos,?but wish she could have influenced her colleagues. I am also calling to say I am strongly opposed to Jeff Sessions for Attorney General and I expect Senator _______ to vote No..
Task 2
Send a tweet real quick.
Yesterday
[Mitch McConnell invoked a Senate?rule about maintaining decorum?to shut?Elizabeth Warren up](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/warren-violates-arcane-rule-sparking-senate-dustup/)
. She was not being indecorous; she was reading a 1986 letter?from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions. He silenced her?because he didn't want to hear it. She is now not?allowed, somehow, to speak on Jeff Sessions until the hearing.
Search Mitch McConnell or?#LetLizSpeak?on Twitter and you'll find some good'uns?to retweet,?and/or tweet your own, such as one of the following:
@SenateMajLdr You misuse the #Senate,?an institution you are tasked with stewarding, to silence someone you disagree with. UnAmerican.
@SenateMajLdr Silencing @SenWarren for reading a letter written?by a #civilrights leader...keep it classy. #LetLizSpeak
@SenateMajLdr blocking Garland #indecorous. Stacking cabinet hearings indecorous. Lying to consolidate power indecorous. Silence yourself.
A note
It is disgusting that Betsy Devos was confirmed. There is an excellent?chance Jeff Sessions will be, too. I feel those pangs of angry, scared helplessness, oh yes I do. But ? even when we lose battles, we are building footholds toward a later?win, and we are?costing the?Trumpists political capital and momentum. Remember that.
We also know our enemies now. How much do you know about Betsy Devos? Probably a lot. How much do you know about Jeff Sessions? Use that information to your advantage.?Volunteer at your local school.
Get involved with your local school board. Find and support a?community empowerment organization or a prisoners' rights group. Protect your own community by making?it as healthy as can be.

,"Good morning!
The Palatine protest featured in

. You guys got a first scoop :-D. Bravo to those 6th district heros! (No outside forces helping, despite what the obviously scared RNC is saying.) I have adapted the letter to a blog post on the inimitable

Okay! Scott Pruitt is up to be confirmed as head of the EPA.
You might recall that the EPA is the agency responsible for ensuring our air, water, and soil does not get so poisoned that we get sick. More info below the task.
Your task
Check your Senators' websites/Facebook pages to see if they have a stance on Scott Pruitt.
If they have taken a stance opposing Scott Pruitt, say:
My name is _____ and I'm ?calling from zip code ______. I would like to thank ______ for his/her stance opposing Scott Pruitt. I'd like him/her to please remain vocal and strong in his/her opposition and to speak to his/her colleagues about it.
If they have taken a stance supporting Pruitt or have remained silent, say:
My name is _____ and I'm ?calling from zip code ______. I am calling because I am opposed to Scott Pruitt's nomination for EPA director. Pruitt's conflicts of interest are very concerning. Additionally, a?strong and independent EPA is essential to my health and yours. I will consider a vote for Pruitt a vote against the health of my family.
Another quick task
Quick. SO quick.
Got Twitter? Good. The House ""Science"" Panel, which is stacked with climate-change deniers and science attackers,
[had a meeting this morning](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/house-science-panel-to-hold-hearing-on-ldquo-making-the-epa-great-again-rdquo/)
which likely included discussing a piece of EPA-crippling legislation that has been chair Lamar Smith's long held dream. Some of you early subscribers may remember
[we've called this panel before,](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-dec-2-2016)
about climate-change denying information they retweeted from Breitbart.
Go to @HouseScience and retweet from the alternative EPA, NASA, and other ""unofficial"" science agencies (since Trump silenced the actual agencies). And/or tweet something yourself, such as:
@HouseScience
@LamarSmithTX21
, burying facts does not make things better. Shame on you.
@HouseScience @LamarSmithTX21 blocking peer-reviewed science will hurt all of us. We see you.
@HouseScience @LamarSmithTX21 You and your families are healthy and safe because of the EPA. @ActualEPAFacts
Bonus
If you have a Republican senator, call and tell them you oppose Betsy DeVos's nomination for Secretary of Education.
[Here's](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-jan-18-2017)
a previous letter with links to sources.
Background
As we've discussed before in this space, Pruitt is
[maybe the most inappropriate pick possible](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/01/20/eight-things-we-learned-scott-pruitt-s-epa-confirmation-hearing/215070)
. He is a lawyer who has spent his career fighting on behalf of companies who have violated EPA regulations. He is, in fact, currently embroiled in lawsuits against the very agency he is testifying to become head of. In word and deed he is openly hostile to the EPA and its work, and in word and deed he openly puts corporate interests before human health interests. He will not accept that human-influenced climate change is real.
[Hundreds of former EPA officials have signed a letter imploring senators to reject Pruitt's nomination.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/06/hundreds-of-current-former-epa-employees-urge-senate-to-reject-trumps-nominee-for-the-agency/?utm_term=.ff48e93d1c71)
It's working
Wondering if making a phone call really matters?

,"Good morning!
The Endangered Species Act came into being in 1973.?Of the more than 2000 animals listed on it, 99% have come back from certain?extinction because of the Act!?That includes our national symbol, the bald eagle, and that is an astonishing success rate. The Act works.
Congress and soon-to-be?Secretary of the Interior
[Ryan Zinke](http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/ryan-zinke)
want?to dump the Endangered Species Act, starting with chipping away at protections for specific wildlife.?House Resolution bill HR424 and its companion bill in Senate, S124,
[eliminate?protections for grey wolves](https://secure.defenders.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=3147&s_src=3WDW1704MHTXX&s_subsrc=hero-home-s164)
and are?the first of many similar bills to follow.
Why should we care about wolves? Some might feel an inherent connection to the natural world, of course. But even if you don't, the fact is?you cannot consider yourself separate from it. You are part of it.?We all are. Plants oxygenate and?clean our air. Plants and animals clean our water and soil. We eat plants, animals who eat plants, and animals who eat animals, and when those food sources are too manipulated?in too unbalanced of a system, people get sick.
[True story](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5927112/chinas-worst-self-inflicted-disaster-the-campaign-to-wipe-out-the-common-sparrow)
:?In 1958, Mao Tze-Tung initiated a sparrow eradication campaign throughout China. Sparrows ate rice grains from crops, and Mao reasoned that, for every million?sparrows killed, 60,000 more people could eat. The campaign worked, and China was literally emptied of sparrows. But, without sparrows to control the insect population, scourges of locusts soon descended upon rice fields, eating?vastly more rice grains than the birds would have. The sparrow campaign was a major contributor to the great famine of 1958-1961, when 30 million people died of starvation.
We can't always predict the consequences of our actions, and we can't make major?changes to the natural world without repercussions
.
Also, wolves are magnificent. Next time you have twenty minutes, say,?in the car or at the bus stop or making dinner or folding clothes, listen to
[this Snap Judgment podcast](http://www.npr.org/2014/05/23/314974039/06-female)
.
Your task
Today, please?call your elected officials. While please everyone call, it's especially important for those who live in or have close ties to
ID, MI, MN, WI, and WY
to call. Those five states have reps who
[co-sponsored the House bill](http://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/424/cosponsors)
, including two Democrats. And MN,?WI, and WY senators
[co-sponsored the Senate bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/164/cosponsors)
; the MN and WI co-sponsors are Democrats.
Say:
My name is ______ and my zip code is ______. I am asking Representative [or?Senator]?_______ to oppose HR 424 [or Senate bill?S124]. Wolves have?just barely?come back from the brink of extinction. We rely on wildlife and wilderness for a healthy ecosystem, which we in turn need to stay healthy.
Numbers may be busy because people have become extremely civically engaged. Please keep trying, or try alternate?numbers, and if that fails, pop 'em a postcard.
I learned an unfortunate thing about faxes ? I was so excited about that idea! But faxes these days just get delivered by?email, so, while it is still a fine way to contact your rep,?it is not really a workaround to the emails-are-easy-to-ignore issue. Calls and letters/postcards still seem best.
THANK YOU, FIVE-MINUTESERS!

,"Good morning!
Oh. Good afternoon. It took me a while to write this one.
Let me tell you a story. I live in a deep-blue city surrounded by a lot of?red?(and some blue)?districts. Democrats and progressive people ? and even moderate?Republicans ??have resigned themselves to not being represented in these red districts.*?They might vote, but the incumbents run unopposed or barely opposed, and constituents,?feeling isolated,?don't see a path toward getting?involved.
My mother lives in a district like this and has often remarked, with resignation,
that she is the only Democrat within?30 square miles.
In fact, my mother lives?in one of the least contested of these red districts,?the 6th district, represented by Republican Peter Roskam. He has won handily since 2007. He
[never meets with constituents](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20170202/BLOGS02/170209952/political-heat-rising-on-gops-roskam)
.?He is as Republican?as can be, enthusiastically supporting?all the far-right stuff the Republican leadership has championed this millennium?and offering zero resistance to Trump.
The Democratic Party of DuPage County asserted in its January community?meeting that they were not going to bother trying to flip?the 6th district; he was too strong. Their strategy for the state lay elsewhere.
But everything has changed since the election, even if the official Democratic Party affiliates?are the last to know it.?After the election, in the amazing nationwide movement that could be known as the Progressive?Activism Facebook Revolution, the group Action 6th District was born.
I don't know how involved you all are on Facebook, but there are groups of thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of progressive people mobilizing for action there. This is one reason lawyers were able to get on the ground immediately upon Trump's executive order targeting Muslims and refugees.
Action 6th District has 640 people in it, and their purpose is to demand that Roskam hear them and be accountable to them. T
he group's?admin, Holly, has done incredible work to keep the group focused and action-oriented. Another group,
called
6th District of Illinois - Holding Rep. Peter Roskam Accountable, has done the same, and there are others as well
.
Members of these groups
call, write, and show?up, every day.?They have been?reprimanded and?belittled by staff. They have been refused meetings,?email addresses, even staffers' names. They have had
[doors closed on them](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-roskam-helath-care-meeting-canceled-st-0202-20170201-story.html)
,
[meetings changed](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20170202/BLOGS02/170209952/political-heat-rising-on-gops-roskam)
from public to private. But they have persisted?and now
[their efforts have earned attention on the national stage](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/peter-roskam-cancels-obamacare-meeting)
.
The Democratic Party of DuPage County
[just this past week announced a change in strategy,](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-roskam-hultgren-trump-backlash-met-20170203-story.html)
publicly stating that flipping the 6th district is one of their focuses. Holly and her cohort did that. When the people lead, the leaders will follow.
This morning Peter Roskam held his?public-turned-private event at a local Party office.?Yesterday,?a Republican committeeman asserted that the uninvited people outside would not be heard and
[scoffed that there would be maybe three protesters and 100 meeting attendees](http://www.journal-topics.com/news/article_36ba593e-ea2c-11e6-b581-a70c07fe97c3.html)
. Accounts and media?from this morning?show over 500?protesters!
Roskam snuck out the back door after the meeting.
A reminder: These folks?""protested"" because their elected official refuses?to meet with them.?Their signs said things like ""Let's talk ? I'll buy the coffee,"" and ""We see you but you won't see us,"" and ""Talk to us ? please?"" and ""Where's Roskam?"" with the rep's face in a Where's Waldo hat.
Here's?a great

;
[NBC5](http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/peter-roskam-protest-palatine-412780383.html)
was the first to report but there will be more as the day goes on
.
Your task!
All this to say,
blue activism within red districts work.
YOU can make a huge difference. Ask Holly. Even if you live in a blue district,?you can support fellow progressives?in?red districts by
showing family and friends?there the power of community action and?helping them get?involved.
That's what I've done with my mother.
You can also help?through sites like
flippable.org, sisterdistrict.com, and swingleft.org.?Your task today is to do a Flippable.org action.
Flippable has identified
[three upcoming special elections](https://www.flippable.org/upcoming-elections)
that need your help. Please donate even just $3 to one or each of them. It makes a difference. The first one, for
[Stephanie Hansen](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/keepdeblue#website)
, is most crucial as well as most urgent.
Note
*We're relatively lucky in my state of?Illinois in that, while the districts are gerrymandered, they are not done so as unconstitutionally as in other states, such as
[North Carolina](http://www.snopes.com/2016/11/30/federal-court-strikes-down-north-carolina-racial-gerrymander/)
and
[Wisconsin](https://www.rt.com/usa/375351-wisconsin-redistricting-legislative-unconstitutional/)
, where Republicans have essentially buried Democratic votes in the way they drew the districts after the 2010 census. Finally, seven years later,?the courts seem to be on it,?but this is one major reason so many state houses and the U.S. Houses are so red.
Representation in state houses as well as U.S. Congress is dangerously lopsided, as the Republicans executed
[a series of?savvy and diabolical strategies?for a total takeover](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/04/the-remarkable-republican-takeover-of-state-legislatures-in-1-chart/?utm_term=.fd5ddda49b28)
after Obama's first election. It's not just Trump ? our country is terribly unbalanced right now, capsizing?to the right. We all need to act.

,"Good...afternoon!
So the new Supreme Court nominee,
[Neil Gorsuch, is a surprisingly good pick](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/31/511850519/who-is-neil-gorsuch-trumps-first-pick-for-the-supreme-court)

But?he is not a crackpot, at least.
[He is qualified](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-gorsuch-supreme-court-20170131-story.html)
.?That's the best we could possibly hope for
given this c
ongress/p
resident/situation.
There are two ways you can go on this. My scripts are long again. Sorry not sorry this time. Adjust to your level of passion and time.
1) Call your Senators and say:
I want?Senator _______ to thoroughly investigate Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch as exhaustively as possible. I'd like you to?focus?specifically on his interpretations of the Constitution that allow him to get into the?pants of private citizens such as the millions and millions of people?in this country
[who use contraception](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/18/the-claim-that-99-percent-of-women-have-used-birth-control/?utm_term=.8bc78d3d8217)
.??Then I want Senator _______ to vote No.
2) Call your Senators and say:
[Republicans]: I am calling about the Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.
[Anyone besides Merrick Garland?must be blocked](http://www.newsweek.com/why-neil-gorsuch-must-not-be-confirmed-supreme-court-eichenwald-551429)
.?Mitch McConnell stole Merrick Garland's chance to even be heard. McConnell committed an unprecedented and damaging?overreach in doing this that we voters will never forget and will always hold you, as a Republican, accountable for. McConnell has?destroyed the trust and the procedure around a hallowed Constitutional process. I am demanding that you and your colleagues in Senate?make it right?vote No on Gorsuch and any other nominee until?Merrick Garland is re-introduced.
[Democrats]:
I am calling about the Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.
[Anyone besides Merrick Garland?must be blocked](http://www.newsweek.com/why-neil-gorsuch-must-not-be-confirmed-supreme-court-eichenwald-551429)
.?Mitch McConnell stole Merrick Garland's chance to even be heard.?McConnell committed an unprecedented and damaging?overreach in doing this that we voters will never forget, and we are demanding that Senate Democrats not forget it either.
Senator _______ and his/her colleagues?have the power to obstruct all candidates?and they must do it. The Republicans have shown over and over and over again that they will put party over country.?The Democrats must ?finally? step up and stop them.?The Democrats must stop fearing threats and possibilities, for example McConnell toppling the filibuster rule. Fine. Take that risk. Show some guts and fight. Save our Constitution. The Democrats must decide as a block to vote No?on anyone but?Garland.
You just might barely?be able to detect that my chosen path is the second. McConnell and this generation of Republican elected officials have
[pulled the football out from under the feet](http://trevinwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1957.gif)
of the hapless, dull, wanting-to-play-by-the-rules Democrats over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Enough is enough is enough. McConnell's Garland move is just unforgivable. The Democrats must learn to fight back. You can't cooperate with bullies. You need to outsmart them and then punch their lights out.
But, if you think operating through compromise,?symbolic gestures, and good faith has been working?for us lately, sure,?go for option 1.

As you know, I generally try to focus on just one topic, but I am taking a page from my friend Victoria's playbook and asking you to snow your elected officials with?several short topics today. We gotta get on top of the avalanche here.
I'm really working on shorter scripts. :) My initial tactic was to?keep?scripts short?and then add background info for your own reading below and/or in links, but there has been some?Script Creep. So! Back to quick scripts. Each of your three calls below?will?be short, literally under two minutes.
Your task
Call your House Rep and say:
1) Please support?Representative?Murphy of?Florida?in
[her bill to protect the National Security Council from interference](http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2017/02/01/stephanie-murphy-files-bill-that-would-remove-stephen-bannon-from-national-security-council)
.
[Steve Bannon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/opinion/president-bannon.html)
is a clear and present?danger to our democracy and our national security.
2) Please reject HR?622.
HR 621 was withdrawn because it was a bad bill; so is 622. It
makes public lands less usable.
3) I am extremely concerned about the reckless and confrontational conversations President Trump has been having with our allies, Mexico and Australia, and others too. This shows either extreme incompetence or a willful desire to threaten our country's safety and success. The American people will not stand for it or for their congressional representatives going along with it.
Call each Senator?and say:
1) Please oppose upcoming?bills that?revoke the?Stream Protection Rule and the BLM Methane and Waste Prevention Rule. The stream rule is a modest measure that?protects?people like you and me from drinking industrial debris. The methane rule makes?American taxpayers money from industrial cleanup and also allows us?to breathe easier. There is no good rationale for either of these bills.
2) Please do
[everything possible](http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-01-31/steve-bannon-on-national-security-council-may-require-senate-confirmation)
to remove Steve?Bannon from the National Security Council. Bannon is a
clear and present
danger to our democracy and our national security and the American people will not stand for Senators going along with him in charge.
3) Please oppose the confirmation of Jeff Sessions, Betsy DeVos,* and Mick Mulvaney.
[Jeff Sessions](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/jeff-sessions-approved-as-attorney-general-by-senate-committee.html)
has proven unable to uphold law over party.
[Betsy DeVos](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/collins-murkowski-to-vote-no-on-education-secretary-nominee/index.html)
has zero experience in public education.
[Mick Mulvaney](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-office-management-budget-trump.html)
holds troubling views on Medicare, Social Security, and the debt ceiling.
Thank you.
Note
*DeVos is 50-50 now with the Senate, because all Dems are voting No and?Collins (R-ME) and Murkowski (R-AK) have broken with party to vote No. Please tailor this part of your message accordingly. The DeVos vote is very soon,?maybe today. If news breaks that she's confirmed/rejected?before you get a chance to call, change the script?to thank/scold your Senators.
Tomorrow
We need to talk about the SCOTUS nominee. However, there are some?factors to discuss and routes to plan, and it's too much for one item on today's multi-pronged five-minute action letter.?Tomorrow, we talk Gorsuch.
THANK YOU FIVE MINUTESERS!

,"Good morning!
There is importantly awful awfully important?legislation set to be voted on today. Please try to get through to your House Rep and?both Senators. I know lines will be very busy because of the Supreme Court pick (don't worry, we'll get to that), but please keep trying. Please don't let the GOP get away with the?efficient destruction of our environment while everyone is looking away!
Got your elected officials' names? Good. Go to their page and find:
Their
phone
numbers, though you should absolutely have these on speed-dial in your phone by now.
Their
fax
number!! Yes, brilliant, thank you to whoever suggested this.?Fax them!?I looked for lists of faxes and only found a couple very out-of-date ones, but your elected officials' pages will have em.

Congress is voting TODAY on
[a series of bills](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/31/public-lands-sell-congress-bureau-management-chaffetz)
including: immediately selling off?public land in Connecticut (the first of many ? see note?below);?stripping the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service of law enforcement capabilities; rolling back
[important protections for stream waters](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gop-moves-undo-obama-rules-protecting-streams-coal-mines/)
; and rolling back regulations?regarding
[public land used by industry](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1942&_ga=1.158296127.406422606.1483218373)
(that also make taxpayers money through usage royalties).
Even if you ?don't get to this action before Congress votes, please still make the call/tweet/fax. Your elected officials need to hear your opposition to their dastardly?actions.
Please alert your people in states/districts?with Republican representatives.
Script?for calling, faxing, emailing, writing - include both paragraphs
I am calling to ask _________ to oppose any efforts to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to undermine clean air, clean water, and safety regulations, including the Stream Protection Rule and the BLM Methane and Waste Prevention Rule. To?pretend?that industry doesn't create pollution or that it will regulate?itself is folly. The Methane and Waste Prevention Rule also earns American taxpayers money in royalties. If you vote to roll back these protections, I see that as a vote against clean water for my children?and a vote against respecting my taxpayer money.
I am also asking _____ to oppose efforts to use the CRA?for the bills Jason Chaffetz introduced ? the 3.3 acres to be given away in House Bill 621?and the companion bill?stripping public lands in the West and Southwest of?law enforcement capacity. These lands are used by hunters, fishermen, campers, hikers, and birdwatchers, not to mention the plants and animals that are part of our national heritage. The land giveaways are a giant taxpayer waste, as we will be compensated hardly or not at all. And access to the outdoors is priceless ??a?vote for giving away our land and reducing capacity to manage them?is a vote saying you don't care about the huge numbers of Americans who treasure their time outdoors.
Tweets
@[electedofficial] NO to using #CRA to undermine #cleanwater/land, strip Americans of #publiclands. We treasure these things. We are watching.
Tweet Jason Chaffetz?@jasoninthehouse, Mitch McConnell
@SenateMajLdr, and Paul Ryan?@SpeakerRyan?as well as your own elected officials.
*All these pieces of legislation are immune to a filibuster because the Republicans passed a series of regulatory bills the first week to immunize themselves against such defenses. The land-sale?bills are possible also because of additional regulatory changes the Republican Congress passed the first week of their session that
[made?it easy to ""dispose of"" public federal land to states](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/bureau-land-management-federal-lease)
, with no financial?compensation or benefit to the American people.

,"Hello all!
You may have juuuuust heard on the news that?DeVos was confirmed. She was confirmed by the Senate HELP
(H
ealth E
d L
abor P

Committee.
The full senate still needs to vote.
Your call about her is still valuable because we need only
three
Republicans to vote No?and she will be not be confirmed. AND,
it's really important that our elected representatives hear from us about whether we approve of their votes.
Below is the whole earlier letter, so you can just carry on from here.
And if you are from any of the states whose Republican?Senator is on the HELP committee, you get to call now and give him/her?a huge dressing down for voting ""aye"" in Committee
just now
. Please let your friends who live in those states?know to call.
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.)
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.)
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)
Sen. Michael B. Enzi (R-Wyo.)

-----------------
Good morning!
Task 1
Today call your Senators about two cabinet nominations. Try EVERY office?until you can get through. Say all three of these things.?If you absolutely must, tweet.
NO on DeVos.
For D senators (all Dems have pledged to vote No):
Thank you for pledging to vote No on DeVos. Please make your voice heard in resisting these awful cabinet picks.
For R senators:
Betsy DeVos has literally no experience with public education and was unable to converse on basic education concepts in her hearing. Our nation's children deserve?someone knowledgeable,?qualified, and supportive of public schools. [If you/your kids go to public school tell a story, e.g.]?""MY KIDS deserve good public schools. As a parent I am worried about what will happen to MY KIDS' excellent public school.""
Tweet:
@[yoursenator] [My kids?go/I went/my spouse went/etc.] to a great public school. DeVos has no public ed experience and knew little about ed concepts. Vote No.
NO on Sessions
Trump's executive order barring refugees and Muslim U.S. residents from entry into the U.S. was unlawful and poorly executed. Given Jeff Session's record and past words,
[I have no confidence he would act as a true independent voice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-democrats-face-a-key-test-tuesday-amid-promises-to-stand-up-to-trump/2017/01/31/1685487a-e7bd-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html?utm_term=.2f8bdd024685&wpisrc=nl_most&wpmm=1)
in a matter like this one.?Vote No on Sessions.
Tweet:
@[yoursenator] Sessions' record of targeting vulnerable people shows he is not able to act as an independent voice upholding the law. Vote No on Sessions.
NO on Pruitt.
D senators:
Pollutants in air and water make a huge difference in health and opportunity for everyday Americans like me?and Pruitt's record shows he puts the enrichment of corporations above people's health. If you care about the health of your constituents, vote No.
R or D senators:
It seems patently obvious that the only way forward in industry and economic progress is to invest in clean technologies for renewable energy. This is a huge market that has not been fully tapped?anywhere in the world and America could be at the forefront.*
Pruitt wants to dismantle the EPA when the EPA could help make America great. If you ?care about our country's economic future, please vote No on Pruitt.
Tweet:
@[yoursenator] We all benefit from clean air and water: you, me,?your kids, my kids, even?Scott Pruitt. NO?on Pruitt
Tweet:
@[yoursenator] Huge mistake for U.S. not to jump on #GreenEnergy industry. Look forward, not back. #MakeAmericaGreat: NO?on Pruitt
*Actually many countries are way ahead of us in this regard, but?let's appeal to our elected officials' inflated sense of Amurrica-ness, and man do we need to get on board.
Task 2
Send off a
[Women's March](http://womensmarch.com/)
-inspired postcard! I know it seems like 1000 years ago but it was only ten days ago and it's important to remember the power of that march and embue other things with that power.?You should have a stack of postcards and stamps now if you did Sunday's and Monday's actions; jot down an issue you care a lot about, add #WhyIMarch, and mail it to one of your elected reps. The Women's March site suggests a senator.?You can also print off a copy of a Women's March logo
[here](https://www.womensmarch.com/)
(scroll down for the?postcard and also instructions I summarized above) and affix to one of the cards you bought.
Keep going
Know that the protests are working. I listened in on an
[Indivisible](http://indivisibleguide.com/)
call last night (I just checked and the link to the recording isn't up yet, but it should be soon), and immigrants are incredibly buoyed by the support that's been rippling through the country,?by the demonstrations and airport rallies. It is so important that people not feel alone, feel others have got their back (that apathy is what got us to where we are today, after all). Lawyers have been abso-freakin-lutely incredible donating their ?free time and their legal capacities to help, tirelessly.
Tirelessly
. They are still doing it because people are still being held. (Check for whether they're working near you and bring them a pizza!)?Elected officials are getting tired of the constant calls and crowds around their offices and so on; patience with Trump is wearing thin.** Your actions work!
(**
just remember a lot of these policies are Republican ones, not Trumpist, so no matter what happens with him,
we keep fighting).
Beyond the 5
If you are interested in moving beyond the five-minute agenda, please visit your local elected officials' offices regularly. Indivisible groups have regular #ResistTrumpTuesdays where people show up at their elected official's offices. Go to

A few things today:
1) Please look back at the
[past few day's letters](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/archive)
and do?an action you didn't get around to. It has been very difficult lately to get a hold of representatives, and after a weekend of phone calls it is highly unlikely you'll be able to leave a VM today. But please?try, and if that doesn't work please email or tweet your message, or make a note to make the call(s) tomorrow am?and take a moment this evening to?donate to CAIR or the ACLU, if you haven't yet, instead. :)
2) Please make a plan to buy a bunch of postcards and stamps tomorrow (or tonight). Because of the difficulty getting through with phone calls, postcards I think are a good thing to have on hand; plus we?need to do the W
omen's M
arch action, which I?moved off this week due to the breathtaking amount of ruining-the-country that's been happening,
and probably most of us?don't have postcards just lying around, so! Task:

[malicious and illegal](https://lawfareblog.com/malevolence-tempered-incompetence-trumps-horrifying-executive-order-refugees-and-visas)
ban, Kalanick lowered Uber prices. If you know Uber at all, you know that when there is greater need for a ride, Uber raises its prices ? its business model is, frankly, to price-gouge when possible ??but in lowering its rates?during the?citywide cab strike?Uber acted essentially as a scab, undermining the strikers?and demonstrating?pointed?lack of interest in?an action that harms a great many people, including?Uber drivers and riders.
In contrast, Lyft donated one million dollars?to the ACLU and issued a?scorching statement against the executive order.
As a result of the negative press, Uber has
[created a $3 million?legal fund](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/29/uber-to-create-3m-legal-defense-fund-for-drivers-affected-by-wrong-and-unjust-ban/)
for its drivers?and issued a statement condemning the ban, and also
[offered a defense](http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/uber-immigration-protests/)
for keeping prices low,?so use your judgment. Me, I've always preferred Lyft because Kalanick's always been sleazy.
If Uber's actions seem ?uber-icky to you, take a minute to?delete your Uber account and switch your habit to?cabs or?Lyfts. Don't just delete your app from your phone ? delete your whole account. The option is?under Help.
Bonus: (More than five minutes.) If you are in a city where there are protests this evening against?Trump's actions, consider going.
Those of you who attended a protest yesterday or donated in support, many thanks.
THANKS, FIVE-MINUTESERS! Keep the faith.

,"Good afternoon,
Yesterday, on Holocaust?Remembrance Day, which was established to remind the ?of?the?unthinkable endgame of racist and xenophobic ideology,
[Trump imposed a ban against Muslim people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html)
from seven different countries entering the U.S. This includes people with dual citizenship,?green cards, and?visas; students, scholars, and travelers have been left in the lurch, some literally detained en route at airports. Hundreds of thousands of American citizens can no longer see their families living in other countries. Thousands?of people who travel for work or school?suddenly no longer have?the ability to do their jobs or get their education.
Of course, this is having major repe
rcussions
for the safety and well-being of the millions of
American
Muslim citizens just living their lives in cities and towns all over the U.S. right now. People
and institutions feel, and are,
[targeted](http://www.nbc26.com/news/national/texas-mosque-burns-to-the-ground-overnight-cause-of-fire-unknown)
and
[in danger](http://www.cair.com/press-center/14061-cair-asks-feds-to-probe-threat-to-blow-up-colorado-refugees.html)
.
Trump's stated reason was the 9/11 attacks. Any stated ""reason"" is illegitimate: this?action absolutely mirrors steps totalitarian regimes take against their targeted scapegoat. Even so, the rationale is also senseless:
[neither the 9/11 attacks nor any terrorist or terrorist-inspired attacks on U.S. soil since](http://time.com/4652405/donald-trump-refugee-ban-silver-lining/)
were perpetrated by citizens of any of those seven countries.
Syrian refugees are part of the ban. People who have lost everything that makes a life: their home, their families, their work, their pets, their gardens, their hopes for the future ? have been cast out as fearsome and?untrustworthy. Before and during WWII, the U.S. refused hundreds of thousands?of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe using the rationale that some might be Nazi spies. Most of these people,
[including a young refugee-hopeful named Anne Frank](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/24/anne-frank-and-her-family-were-also-denied-entry-as-refugees-to-the-u-s/)
,?died in the Holocaust in camps.
Christian Syrian refugees?are excused. While it is nice that a small percentage of war victims are being granted a chance to?escape their slaughter, this distinction of whose life is worth saving, based on religion,?is beyond?loathsome.
Here is what you can do. Choose one or more actions.
General info for talking to elected representatives and your faith communities:
If someone supports the ban or has not yet stated a position, say
: This ban
will not make us safer in any way and is?a dangerous leap into religious and ethnic scapegoating, which has literally never aided the U.S. in its security or prosperity. No decent human with
compassion who pays any attention to history
could ever support these orders.
If?someone is against the ban, say
: T
hank them and ask them what
they are doing to help those affected. If applicable and you have time, ask what you can do to help.

This week the House passed a bill that makes the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer money from??being used for abortion care, permanent. T

Similar bills have?been introduced before and have?never become law. There are?reasons bills like this get introduced over and over ??to normalize extreme positions, to wear down resistance, to keep a?base energized.

passed the Hous
e; the next step is the Senate.
Call
[your senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/)
and say:
I am calling to ask you to vote NO on?HR?7. The bill discriminates against people with low incomes by making??an essential health service too costly to access.
People don't get abortions for fun. They do it because it is the best choice
.
Women vote and women want to be treated as independent adults who can make their own decisions. And by targeting people with low incomes, t
his shameful bill?exploits

,"Good morning!
Some of you responded yesterday with your own journalistic sources - thanks!
[Here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-dec-3-2016)
is a larger (and still incomplete) list?I made last month.
Senator Jeff Sessions is set to be confirmed early next week for attorney general.
[He has a long history](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general.html)
of using his seat in congress and?before that?his position as Alabama attorney general to make it much harder for Black people, immigrants, gay people, and women to access their civil rights and freedoms.
Sessions' record is particularly strong on helping Republicans find ways to suppress voter turnout in minority communities. This is especially timely because this week Trump has been
[repeating the vile lie](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-election-idUSKBN1591FP)
that there is widespread voter fraud, in the millions,?perpetrated mostly by?""illegals"" (his most recent rationale was a
[bizarre personal anecdote](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html)
about?people waiting to vote who ""did not look as if?they should be allowed to vote."") The fear is that these?unfounded accusations?will?pave the way for yet more
[unlawful and?discriminatory?voting restrictions](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/where-is-voter-discrimination-the-worst/)
in the name of fair elections.*?With Sessions as attorney general, there is significant danger that these restrictions?will be all the stronger.
Please call both of
[your senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/)
and say:
I am a constituent and I am calling for two related reasons.
First, I am asking Senator _______?to oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, using the full 30 hours of debate allotted. Sessions has worked his entire career to make it harder for people to vote. He has consistently enacted and supported discriminatory law and policy.
Secondly, has Senator _______ issued a statement about Donald Trump's repeated lies regarding voter fraud?
If Yes:
Please thank the Senator for me, and ask him/her to continue to speak out loudly against these lies.?They?harm our democracy and make the Jeff Sessions pick even more worrisome.
If No or they don't?know:
I am asking Senator _______ to repeatedly and loudly call Donald Trump out about these lies. They harm our democracy
and make the J
eff Sessions pick even more worrisome.
*(Also that the highest leader of?our land lying constantly about everything is an absurd
[Orwellian?nightmare](http://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-the-past-was-erased-the-erasure-was-forgotten-the-lie-became-the-truth-george-orwell-51-25-98.jpg)

Tom Price, the nominee for Health and Human Services, is having a hearing with?the Senate Finance Committee today (he had his hearing with the health committee last week). There are
[many](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/hhs-nominee-tom-price-backed-extreme-anti-choice-personhood-bills/)

reasons to resist Tom Price's appointment, but the salient one today is that he has
[ethical conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/health/tom-price-health-secretary.html)
;?he has heavy investments in the health industry, and as a Congressional rep?he has proposed legislation to benefit the companies that benefit him. How can we have confidence that his interests as Secretary of Health and Human Services are people and not his portfolio?

very?concerned about Tom Price's conflicts of interest
. His investments in the health industry and his efforts to help those same industries?through his legislation?conflict?with his potential role as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Thank you.
If you get a busy signal or full VM,?try a different office number. Their lines are very very busy, which is a GOOD thing, but it does mean it might take more than one try.
When you call your senators and governor, if you have a personal story about how the ACA, Planned Parenthood, Medicare and/or Medicaid saved you or?a family member's health/life,
share it
. Ask the governor's office if they have a plan for paying for people's health needs?if Price guts these programs.

[With, he says ""concerns.""](http://time.com/4643365/marco-rubio-rex-tillerson-support/?xid=homepage)
Since he has reservations, please STILL PHONE HIM. Say:
I am disappointed in the vote for Rex Tillerson.?We deserve a Secretary of State who will defend our values, not Russia's. Our national security and future influence could be compromised with this appointment. I am asking Senator Rubio to hold Tilleron closely accountable for his actions throughout the tenure of his appointment.
If you are asked if you are a constituent, say you are calling Senator Rubio in his capacity on the Foreign Relations Committee. If you have a relative/friend in FL, you can also say you have close friends/family who are voters there. (But please don't claim this if it is untrue.)

The Democrats lost 900 seats during the Obama years. Two thirds of our states have Republican governors and many of those also have Republican majorities in their state houses.?Flipping seats?from red to blue in 2018 and 2020?is crucial. Flipping?STATE congressional seats?is as important as flipping?U.S. Congress seats, and your state politics are going to become more and more important as the extremist Republican Congress and Trump cabinet in Washington decimate federal agencies. Because the census is done every ten years, the party in power in 2020 in the various states gets to redraw the districting map. The DNC/Obama's biggest mistake of his administration was to look the other way when the Republicans redrew our U.S. Congressional districts. They drew it in such as way that they?created a few deep deep blue districts and many safely red districts, thus ensuring big GOP?wins no matter how unpopular their ideas. Fact: There are more people who vote democrat in the US than who vote Republican. Fact: Dems?are so steamrolled right now.
So! What does all that mean? It means you need to find a way that works for you to support winnable Democratic candidates in state and US seats and you must pay close attention to your governor as well.

Your task
This task thanks to lawyer-badass Jennifer, whose language I lifted pretty much wholly. Thank you Jennifer!
This afternoon the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil CEO with deep ties to Russia and no diplomatic experience.
Just one Senate Republican is left standing in his way: Marco Rubio. He's undecided and has expressed great skepticism about Tillerson. Rubio could swing the committee vote against him and deliver Trump this important defeat.
Call Marco Rubio now at 202-224-3041.?Say:
I am asking Marco Rubio to vote No on Tillerson. We deserve a Secretary of State who will defend our values, not Russia's. Our national security and future influence could be compromised with this appointment.

If you STILL get a busy signal, tweet. Please do try calling first. It is far more effective.
@marcorubio, Please vote No on #Tillerson. The American people want a Secretary of State who will?defend our values, not Russia's.
OK! Good job! Now below is a giant but still partial list of other action-oriented things you could check out. Get some coffee and enjoy.

Welcome, new subscribers!
As you probably know, the turnout for the Women's Marches were historic in their numbers and spread. They were also beautiful in their positive hopeful energy and their community spirit. And
[the signs were really great](http://people.com/politics/womens-march-on-washington-best-signs/)
.
Yesterday, Trump's first day in office,
[Press Secretary Sean Spicer gathered media](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/sean-spicer-fact-check/index.html)
,?not to lay out plans for the first 100 days, not to deliver a message of getting to work, not even to brag about the inauguration, but to complain bitterly about media coverage of?inauguration attendance. It is alarming enough that Trump's choice of subject matter for this very first press briefing was the size of his inauguration. But, worse, Spicer backed up his assertions with lies: his claims that the numbers were larger than any other inauguration can be
[proven verifiably false](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/21/sean-spicer/trump-had-biggest-inaugural-crowd-ever-metrics-don/)
through?photographs and video, metro ticket sales, and other incontrovertible evidence. Spicer then ended the briefing without taking?questions.
Attendance size is trivial, but Spicer's?treatment of the media?dressing them down with?repeated?mantras of their dishonesty,?insisting that untruths are truths, and then leaving?is not trivial. Whitehouse ""counselor"" Kellyanne Conway said today that
[Spicer was not lying, but telling ""alternative facts.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts/index.html)
Your task is to thank those media outlets that reported his lies as lies and her defense as lies, and/or to ask those that didn't why not.
First, check your local paper and see if their coverage includes not only?the fact that the briefing happened, but that?Spicer lied and Conway called his lies ""alternative facts."" Email to thank them or correct their oversight accordingly.
If you have another few minutes, send a letter or tweet to a few others:
Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the Press
[would not let Kellyanne?Conway get away](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/wh-spokesman-gave-alternative-facts-inauguration-crowd-n710466)
with calling Spicer's lies ""alternate facts.""
[Email](mailto:contact.nbcnews@nbcuni.com)
or
[tweet](http://twitter.com/MEETTHEPRESS)
to thank him.
CNN declined to air the briefing live, choosing instead to continue their coverage of the women's marches, and has written extensively about

,"Good evening!
I'm really sorry for the very late letter today.
Your task for what's left of today?is to make a note to yourself to?become aware when you start feeling overwhelmed and hopeless about this administration, and to stop doing the thing that makes you feel that way.
Example: People have been posting furious?notifications that this page or that site on whitehouse.gov has been taken down?the climate change site, the LGBTQ ?site. This causes panic to begin to rise in my chest. And then I remember: We already knew this. We already knew the principles and priorities?we've traveled with for eight years?will be turned on their heads. We already know we need to fight to maintain that truth is a thing.?Er, we also know that any incoming administration is going to redo the site of the previous administration?(do you think Obama's administration just used what W?left behind?).
So I stopped paying attention to those posts. Posts like that?whip?up fear, nothing else. They do not lead to action and they do not tell us anything we don't already know.?There is reason to feel?fear,?but there is no reason to dwell in it.
Reading articles that cause you to?cry? If you are mourning, if you are feeling the feels?good. Cry.?But if you sense yourself spiraling into anxiety because of the article?stop. It's not serving you. You're not learning anything.

Strangely, I feel increasingly hopeful and energized. The dread I had been carrying, which peaked at?the New Year?January 2017, the?month of the inauguration, the year of the first 100 days?that dread?has receded.
This is because I see incredible movement all around me. I see groups of thousands, ten thousands,
[hundreds of thousands](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/can-a-facebook-group-of-120000-lawyers-save-america-from-trump)

,"Good morning!
More senate hearings this week! Sorry this week is so repetitious with our action items, but that's what happens when your nation's congressional leaders shove a whole bunch of important actions into a few days in order to escape scrutiny and transparency.
Task 1
If you have not yet called to protest the nomination of Scott ""Abolish the EPA"" Priutt to lead the EPA, please do so.
[Here](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-jan-16-2017)
is the script. If you like
[mercury-free water](http://time.com/4635162/scott-pruitt-science-denial/)
and breathable air,?please. Do this action. His hearing is today. John Barrasso Repub. chair (202) 224-6441 or (307) 362-5012; Tom Carper ranking Dem:?(202) 224-2441?or??(302) 573-6291; and/or
[choose senators](http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/members)
on the committee.
Task 2
The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held Betsy DeVos' hearing yesterday and
[she did not know basic education terminology and policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-senate-hearing.html)
. She has literally zero professional or even personal experience in public education. However, against normal protocol, Republican Committee chair Lamar Alexander allowed each senator only one round of questioning rather than two, and she was given her hearing before her ethics check was completed. This is a clear attempt to dodge scrutiny of a weak candidate.
AAAANNDDD,
Tom Price is also having his hearing today.
[You might recall](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-december-8-2016)
he is the guy who fought to institute personhood, the belief that fertilized eggs have rights, and who wants to replace the ACA, who is now poised to become our Health and Human Services lead. He also has significant
[conflicts of interest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/18/facing-the-senate-wednesday-hhs-nominee-price-will-defend-gops-health-care-overhaul/)
in his investments with the health sector.
SOOOOO,
[call the two senators](http://www.help.senate.gov/)
on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee that you called yesterday (leads: Repub Chair
[Lamar Alexander](http://www.alexander.senate.gov/)
, (202) 224-4944 or (865) 545-4253 and ranking Dem
[Patty Murry](http://www.murray.senate.gov/)
(202) 224-2621 or (253) 572-3636. They have additional offices if you can't get through on those numbers.
SAY:
I am calling for two reasons. First, I am very disappointed in committee chair's decision to allow only one round of questioning of Betsy DeVos and to allow her hearing to go ahead before the ethics investigation was concluded. Both of these actions look like clear attempts to avoid scrutiny. Our nation's children deserve a well vetted and well qualified Secretary of Education.
Secondly, I? am extremely concerned about Tom Price's appointment to head Health and Human Services. He supports the dismantling of the ACA without replacement. He holds extremist, medically ignorant views around ""personhood."" He holds personal investments in the health care sector. He is a troubling candidate that I and my family and associates do not want to see in this position.
Bonus
Tweet Lamar Alexander:?Not cool to limit #DeVos questions, blow past ethics check, @SenAlexander. Not cool at all. Sure looks like you know she's a weak candidate.

Task 2
Betsy DeVos is going to undergo her vetting to be Secretary of Education also today. Let's do a fun thought experiment: Imagine the experience and principles that might characterize
the person least?suited to steward our public education and the good of all the children in it
.
Did you come up with someone who's never been to public school? Who's never sent their kids to public school? Who's never been a classroom teacher? Who is a zealous Christian who has pushed for vouchers to use public moneys for religious schools? Who is a billionaire who has never had to think about public services in her life? Who is a strong backer of ""free-market"" ""solutions"" to public education challenges, such as reducing oversight of for-profit charters and online schools?
You have just described Betsy DeVos, our nominee for Secretary of Education!
Your task
Look at
[this list](http://www.help.senate.gov)

I am calling to express my concern about Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary. Public schools are a bedrock of American Democracy. She has never been a teacher or worked in a school, and she has never attended or sent her own kids to public schools. She doesn't even have a degree in education. Why in the world would she be qualified to lead America's public schools??Betsy DeVos has given a tremendous amount of money and support to privatized charters, online schools, and vouchers that direct tax dollars to religious and other private schools. I demand that my tax dollars to go to my public schools. [Tell story about how your family benefits from public schooling. It can be your personal experience or your simply witnessing the vibrant, hardworking community of your neighborhood school.] Betsy DeVos is not qualified to be our Secretary of Education. Please vote No.

,"Good morning!
There are a
[crap-ton of senate hearings](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html?ref=politics)
coming up this week for totally unacceptable cabinet nominees. Each nominee is just more comically dangerous than the last. So, in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s amazing work for racial and economic?justice, we are going to try to save the friggin planet. It might take six minutes instead of five, because there are TWO important tasks today.?Today offices are closed but?you can leave a message. If you cannot get through,
please
try tomorrow, or, if you must, le sigh, email.
Task 1
On Tuesday the
[Committee on Energy and Natural Resources](http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/members)
will consider
[Ryan Zinke for Secretary of the Interior](http://earthjustice.org/features/what-you-should-know-about-ryan-zinke-the-interior-department)
. The Secretary of the Interior is in charge?of our?national parks, wildlife refuges, historic landmarks, and some?offshore areas. Zinke has shown hostility to the endangered species act and support for fracking and drilling on public lands, and, of course, denies climate change.
CALL: Two of the people on
[this list](http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/members)
. Choose Senators from states you have a connection with
(not Daines?Zinke is a U.S. rep for MT)
. If you have no connection, call the chair and the ranking member.
SAY:
I am calling to share my concern about Ryan Zinke for Secretary of Interior. One of my most treasured experiences with my kids/family?is [talk about?a?natural/wilderness experience, if possible in the state the senator is from. Hunting counts].?Representative?Zinke has consistently voted to weaken the standards that make these?experiences possible. I do not want our irreplaceable?public lands and wildlife to?be disturbed and?degraded for energy exploration. Our parks and wildlife refuges are among our greatest national treasures. Please?make it clear that, should Zinke be appointed, he will be challenged and held responsible for
actions that benefit?industry at the expense of the American public.
Task 2:
On Wednesday the
[Committee on the Environment and Public Works](http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/members)
will consider
[Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA](http://earthjustice.org/features/what-you-should-know-about-scott-pruitt-the-epa)
. The EPA protects Americans against contamination and pollution in the?ground, water, and air. Scott Pruitt has fought long and hard in favor of fossil fuel industries and wishes to abolish the EPA. He is a horrifying choice for EPA head. Oh and, of course,?he denies?climate change.
CALL:
Two of the people
[on this list](http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/members)
. Choose Senators from states you have a connection with (not Inhofe?Pruitt is attorney general?for OK).?If you have no connection, call the chair and the ranking member.
SAY:
I am calling to share my concern about Scott?Pruitt for EPA head. He presents?a disturbing conflict of interest because he has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from fossil-fuel reliant energy companies. He?has sued?the EPA on behalf of fossil fuel interests and in fact?wants to abolish the EPA. We cannot entrust him with the leadership of the EPA. I strongly value my clean air and water and?[I trust that my children can play out side because of the EPA/I visited such-and-such country without standards and the air pollution was terrible/I've seen an enormous improvement in my own area since the 80s/etc.]. Scott Pruitt is a disturbing pick for EPA lead and I urge you to vote No.?Thank you.

,"Good afternoon,
Among the things the Republican Congress is preparing, in anticipation of Trump's entry into office, is the roll-back of
[reproductive health](http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/11/29/media-fail-explain-impact-hhs-nominee-tom-price-s-health-care-agenda/214650)
and
[choice](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-01-06/planned-parenthood-met-by-locked-door-at-paul-ryans-office)
policies. Because of the gift and the burden of their biology, women bear the brunt of these roll backs.
It is almost impossible for me to express how upsetting and terrifying these rollbacks are for me. Many of you might feel the same.
If you are a man
, gay or straight, and you have not thought much about reproductive choice,
please start thinking about it.
A sicker, less educated society that has less control over when and how it wants to start families
[affects every single person in the country](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-broader-benefits-of-contraception/373856/)
, men too.
[This is a worldwide fact](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/general/lancet_3.pdf)
.
I don't know why this is not part of the conversation.
Your task
Your task today is to spend a few minutes writing down why reproductive choice is important to you?
men, this task is even more important for you
.
Write about how the ability to have a family (or not) when and how worked best for you has helped you and/or people you love. Think about the entities that have helped you stay reproductively healthy and informed throughout your reproductive life. Save what you write down; you will be calling members of Congress in the days and weeks to come.
If you cannot think of any experiences with the above, ask a female friend or family member what she thinks.
Here are my general thoughts on the matter, if it helps:
Women-controlled birth control such as the pill is responsible for advances for women in their careers. Period.
Reproductive rights are responsible for advances for women in their personal freedom
and safety
since the '70s. Period. It is vastly easier to get out of an abusive or simply bad situation when your capacity as a mother cannot be manipulated or forced on you.
Reproductive rights are responsible for advances for women in their personal finances. Period. Women have far greater ability to plan and control their own lives, and therefore can make relationship choices that aren't related to their basic survival and comfort.
Eliminating access to reproductive health care would cause hardships for family units, not just the women in them. It would change
[the economic, educational, and social balances](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/the-economic-impact-of-the-pill/)
we've attained in the past few generations.
Eliminating access to reproductive health care implies that there is shame, caprice, or frivolousness?or all three?in needing reproductive health care. Women's bodies are not shameful. Women needing care for their bodies is not capricious. Wanting birth control is not frivolous.
Maybe you don't like abortion. No one
likes
abortion. Abortion is one end of the reproductive health spectrum, and it's needed. The choice of whether to get an abortion is complex and painful?the very choice that it is cruel, ignorant, and oppressive to legislate. Reproduction takes two, but anti-choice policy puts the entire cause, effect, and burden of sexuality on women.
[As fake Arianna Huffington said on SNL's Weekend Update](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/35/f0/74/35f074bc1708a4b3cd568ca1b20d4d34.jpg)
, if men could have babies abortions would be available on every corner like Starbucks. Anti-choice policy forces an uninformed decision on people who are perfectly capable of making the ?decision themselves and who know much, much more about their specific situation. Anti-choice policy is cruelest and most oppressive to poor people most of all, as poverty strips one of the means, time, and control to seek out barely accessible or illegal options. Making abortion illegal or inaccessible doesn't stop abortions. It just stops legal ones.

,"Good morning! Two tasks today. It should still take just a few minutes. The ACA, which has provided imperfect but crucial health coverage for millions of people, is being dismantled, with glee, by the Republican Congress. They have no replacement.
Task 1
This week, Mitch McConnell led his Republican Senate to
[begin repeal of the ACA in a middle-of-the-night vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/health-care-congress-vote-a-rama.html)
.?Look at
[this helpful infographic](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/03/us/politics/why-it-will-be-hard-to-repeal-obamacare.html?ref=politics)
to better understand how the Senate dismantled the ACA, which is a complicated measure; note, though, that even the things not immediately in filibuster-proof danger, such as coverage for contraception and pre-existing conditions,
[are still on the chopping block](http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/the-senate-just-voted-to-roll-back-womens-healthcare.html)
. The Senate Democrats
[fought back](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/politics/senate-obamacare-repeal/)
, repeatedly interrupting votes and putting forth amendments designed to highlight just what the Republicans were trashing (they amendments all failed).
[Write](http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/officelocations)
or
[email](https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contactform)
McConnell and say something like:
I am disgusted with your practice of holding important votes in the middle of the night, such as the one to repeal the ACA. Your complete disrespect for transparency, decency, and integrity will be remembered.
(You'll have to shorten it if you tweet.)
Aw, hell.
Let's all tweet
* too/instead,?if you have Twitter. Vary it a little, if you can, so it doesn't look canned. AND! Let's all please
retweet and like
each other. Scan for similar tweets and show support.
Tweet and like/retweet:
[@SenateMajLdr](https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr)
Why hold crucial votes in the dead of night, such as the #ACArepeal? Your dodging and disrespect will be remembered.
Task 2
Some Republicans are concerned about repealing without replacing because
[repealing the ACA will be very costly](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/04/heres-how-gop-repeal-of-obamacare-would-swell-the-federal-deficit.html)

,"Good morning!
While PeeGate is funny, it is a distraction from this week's outrageous schemes in Congress and the incoming administration. It's frankly perfect timing for McConnell's Senate hearings.
Thanks to your efforts,
[four nominees' hearings have been delayed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-nominations.html)
, three of them because their ethics investigations are not yet completed. Hard work! <clap clap>?Pays off! <clap clap> Good job, team!
Now we need to keep up the pressure, not get distracted by comedy-spy movie hijinks.
(There are serious charges as well as titillating ones and?we will address conflicts of interest and um collusion with a hostile foreign power later. Meanwhile,?hearings are happening as we speak.)

@marcorubio
Call your own Senators, too.
Say:
I have serious concerns about the Rex?Tillerson in the role of Secretary of State given his
[documented extensive business and personal partnership?with Vladmir Putin](http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/11/investing/rex-tillerson-exxon-russia-putin/)
as the CEO of ExxonMobil and the recent allegations regarding Russia's role in Trump's political path. It is imperative that Mr. Tillerson?be asked in detail about the latest Russia report.
For Rubio add:
I want to thank Senator Rubio for asking Rex Tillerson hard questions and ask that he continue to press for a thorough vetting and to consider the concerns I've expressed.
Note:?Voicemails might be full. If that happens, send an email using the script above?and/or tweet. It is amazing and wonderful that so many people around the country are so invested but adding your voice is super?important.
Oh guess what! Elaine Chao, McConnell's wife, is having her hearing for Secretary of Transportation right now,?at the same exact time as the Tillerson hearing. This is unfair and gross, but I'd expect nothing less of McConnell's senate, and since?we are being forced to pick battles, Tillerson is?the more concerning.

,"Good morning!
The Republican Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, is barreling through with?vetting up to nine cabinet picks this week. Many of these cabinet picks have not yet been fully?vetted for conflicts of interest, integrity with tax records, and other common procedures that every single cabinet pick has been vetted for in living memory.
The head of the Office of Government Ethics,?a nonpartisan federal watchdog,
[said in a letter](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/313175-ethics-office-accuses-gop-of-rushing-trump-cabinet-confirmations)
that ""the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me...I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.?
The purpose is to?flood the news media with so much information that they cannot focus on one candidate's qualifications (and
[make a big show of dominance](http://www.theonion.com/graphic/mitch-mcconnell-inflates-throat-pouch-in-show-of-d-34747)
, no doubt). Any one of these candidates might be a full-blown story with a lot of controversy, but when there are five or six in a day, those stories can't happen.
In 2009,
[McConnell demanded the cabinet procedure he is now ignoring](https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/818115535523246081)
.
Call Mitch McConnell.
(202) 224-2541,
(
502) 582-6304,?(859) 224-8286,?(859) 578-0188,?(606) 864-2026,?(270) 781-1673,?(270) 442-4554.
If you can't get a hold of someone at any of his offices, email
[here](https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contactform)
.
Say:
I am extremely concerned that the cabinet nominees slated for hearings this week?have not been fully vetted and are being jammed through all at once. This standard vetting procedure is not a partisan issue and in fact it is one Senator McConnell has insisted on in the past. Why is he holding himself to a different standard than others in regards to holding hearings??Moreover, what if something turns up later that Congress and the American people?could have learned of now had the candidates?gone through the proper procedure? Senator McConnell and his supporters?will be held responsible for that. I am calling to demand these hearings be conducted at a reasonable pace that allows the proper ethics checks?and allows Senator McConnell's?colleagues and the American people to have a chance to learn about each nominee.
If you are asked if you are a constituent, say you are?calling McConnell in his capacity as Senate Majority Leader, an important position that holds responsibility to all Americans.
Then call your own Senators and say the same. For Democratic Senators skip the bit about Senator McConnell's supporters being held responsible.

Go

If you don't have an ACA story, please don't make one up; forward this link to someone you think might.
And if you have another thirty seconds, copy and paste your story to your own elected officials.
Let's flood McConnell and the rest of 'em with good reasons not to take away people's health care without any sort of plan!
Note:
The Republicans plan to
[defund Planned Parenthood as part and parcel of the ACA repeal](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/paul-ryan-planned-parenthood-obamacare/)
.
Public funding has not paid for abortion services?since 1976?due to the

these measures are being brought up and passed. A good example is the decision to review six cabinet appointees in one day. This makes transparency and proper vetting impossible. It
shows a lack of regard for the American people and a tolerance for deceptive practices.
Please do everything you can to slow or stop these destructive measures and shady procedures, and please vote NO on REINS, RAA, and the Midnight Rules.
If you have time, call Mitch McConnell. Or write him. I've never been able to get through to his phone line. I am beginning to suspect it's not even staffed.
Call your House rep and say:
I am calling because I am alarmed about the many measures being proposed and passed by the Republican Congress that limit transparency, reduce the ability for vital government agencies to function, and undo important safeguards, such as the REINS Act, the RAA, new rules packages, and the Midnight Rules bill. I am also gravely concerned and unnerved by the
way
these measures are being brought up and passed. They are being discussed and decided on behind closed doors and very quickly. This makes transparency and proper vetting impossible. It
shows a lack of regard for the American people and a tolerance for deceptive practices.?Please do everything you can to slow or stop these destructive measures and shady procedures and please vote NO on the RAA.
If you have time, call Paul Ryan. His line is usually open for VM, at least, though I got a busy signal today (haven't heard THAT noise in a couple decades!). Busy busy!
A general strategy note
If you only have time to call one person, choose the Republican. If you don't have a Republican elected official, choose the Democrat who is less likely to already be pushing back. But try to call all of 'em.
Background
The Republicans have begun
[an assault of regulatory changes](http://bit.ly/2iQsQEy)
that are designed to make it easier for them to trash regulations that keep us safe,
[target](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/312797-house-gop-revive-rule-that-lets-lawmakers-slash-gov-employees)
and
[intimidate people](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-04/house-gop-gives-staff-broader-new-powers-to-grill-witnesses)
they disagree with,
[dodge transparency and accountability](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2017/01/03/house-votes-fine-members-up-2500-if-they-take-videos-chamber/96120998/)
, and
[undo basically everything Obama recently?did to protect people and places without considering the individual merits of any](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/312730-house-passes-bill-to-overturn-midnight-regulations-en-masse)
. These are small regulatory things, not big splashy bills, and they all are getting passed in a big hurry this week,?so it's just a blitz.
Speaking of a blitz,
[the Republicans are planning to vote on six of Trump's cabinet appointees at once](http://wapo.st/2hV1JbU)
. This means that there will not be proper time to vet them and no one horrible, awful, no-good candidate will dominate the news cycle; it protects the?candidates, almost to a one of which are laughably inappropriate for their position. It is thought that all of the candidates will get appointed. Yes, the avowed racist to determine who gets prosecuted and punished, and why (Jeff Sessions for Attorney General).?Yes, the creationist who wants to dismantle public schools?to run our public education system (billionaire Betsy DeVos). Yes, the oil tycoon with strong and friendly ties to Putin and business dealings around the world to manage our international relationships (former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson).
The Republicans are toying with
[getting rid of the filibuster](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/opinion/why-republicans-shouldnt-weaken-the-filibuster.html)
, currently the Democrats' only procedural tool.
Mitch McConnell
[actually literally said](http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/mitch_mcconnell_the_american_people_simply_will_not_tolerate_blocking_a_supreme_court_nominee_video)
""The American people will not tolerate"" blocking a Supreme Court nominee. The guy who has blocked Merrick Garland since February.

Good morning!
The Republican led Congress is NOT wasting any time serving up everything they've been brewing for the past eight years and more. They've tried?to get the REINS Act passed at least four times before, and it always failed. Now is their chance?the vote in the House?on REINS is scheduled for today at noon.
It is important to call before noon eastern.
Say:
Republicans: I
am calling to ask Rep. ______ to please, please not vote for the REINS Act.?Food safety, worker safety, air pollution, water contamination, are all at risk.?Ignoring matters that are concerning or complex will not make the issues go away. Asserting that we don't need to listen to people who know a lot about these matters and who have spent years and taxpayers' money developing solutions is not?wise.?I am watching, and if Rep. ______ votes for this bill, I will know that that means (s)he cares more about party than people and is voting against the health and safety of our people and our land and water.
Democrats:
I am calling to ask Rep _____ to please fight hard and loud against the REINS Act. There is a reason this Act didn't pass four times before. I value our worker safety and clean air and water, and I respect the work done by experts in the fields targeted by the REINS Act. I want Rep.?______ to make his/her constituents' voices heard.
Rationale
To quote from
[ombwatch.org](http://www.ombwatch.org/three-reasons-reins-act-must-be-stopped-again)
:?""The bill would require that Congress approve standards and safeguards within 70 legislative days.? If both chambers fail to meet this deadline, the rules in question would be 'tabled,'?essentially killing them.
""Under the REINS Act, Congress would second-guess agency expertise and science on food safety, worker safety, air pollution, water contamination, and a host of other issues.? When developing protective rules, agencies already go through a lengthy, multifaceted process that includes several layers of study, review, and public comment.? Politicizing agency science and the rulemaking process at the behest of special interests is indefensible.""
The REINS Act was devised by a

, which confirms my suspicion that this act sounds like it was written by someone who doesn't understand how government works and who doesn't respect that others may know things that he himself doesn't. We have regulations for a reason. People who hate regulations remind me of anti-vaxxers. They forget the reason they don't have to worry about a horrible ill

,"Hello!
Thanks to yours and thousands of others' phone calls, the Republican-led House of Representatives dumped their plan to gut their own ethics office. Yes, Trump tweeted a rebuke to them as well...but
[the word on the Floor](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/01/03/reps_say_phone_calls_prompted_ethics_reversal.html)
is that it was all your angry calls that caused them to ditch the idea.*
For now. While we have
[every reason to celebrate?our power of the people](http://preview.mailerlite.com/l3w0h5/532489737068352055/b4v5/)
, you can bet that this proposed rule change will come back up as soon as they think no one is looking. To that end, and because
[some other stupid stuff passed in the rules package yesterday](http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2017/The-House-is-establishing-new-rules-for-the-115th-Congress/id-f035046abb0a4354bf0eb7840a4312dc)
, we are going to call our reps again today.
Your task
Call and say:
I am calling to say I am really glad the House listened to its constituents and eliminated the proposed rule change to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. However, I am disappointed that two other awful rules changes were passed, namely making it
[easier for Congress to sell or give away federal land](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/03/house-gop-rules-change-would-make-it-easier-to-sell-off-federal-land/?utm_term=.e33945bb4e07)
, and empowering Republican leaders?to
[fine members who take pictures or video on the House floor](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-dec-30-2016)
. Our public lands are for all of us, and it is Congress' responsibility to protect these lands, not put them up for grabs. And the measure to fine people for recording is a cynical way to reduce transparency and accountability.
[For Democrats:]
I want Representative ______ to keep fighting against measures such as these. This rules package is not acceptable.
[For Republicans:]
I am extremely disappointed that the Republicans continue to put their own power before the good of the American people. Representative _______ was hired to represent us, not his/her party.
If you have a few more minutes
Call Ryan (202-225-0600) and say the above.
Call Nancy Pelosi (202-225-0100),?who was quite vocal against this rules package, and thank her. Make sure to mention how important the land-grab thing is to you -- her protest focused mostly on the ethics office thing and the fining-members-who-record thing.
THANKS!
Note: Since the Republicans gathered in secret?Monday night to vote include the failed measure, we don't know which Republican voted No and which voted Yes.
[This article](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/house-republicans-gut-their-own-oversight-233111)
lists a few Ayes and Nays, and
[this one](https://sunlightfoundation.com/public-whip-count-for-vote-on-changes-to-office-of-congressional-ethics/)
shows some additional info, so?if you are in a Republican district please do take a moment to look at these, and if your rep was one of the Nos, thank him/her.
*
(Trump might have tweeted this as a way to steal the spotlight away from Democratic/progressive house members and constituents like you, who were energetically opposing the rules change...it's pretty certain, imo, he didn't do it because of some ethical stance, since he has demonstrated an inhuman absence of ethics.)

,"Good morning!
Sigh.
The Republican House's very first point of action upon being seated, yesterday,?was?to
[gut?its own independent investigation body](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/house-republicans-vote-eviscerate-office-congressional-ethics/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=pbsofficial&utm_campaign=newshour)
. The?non-partisan Office of Congressional Ethics?was set up in 2008 to reduce corruption in Congress?and has since investigated and referred for justice actions?Congressional members from both parties who were engaging in bribery and other corruption. Led by Bob Goodlatte (R-Va), the Republican majority added this measure with no warning into a rules package on?Monday, Jan. 2.?So we know what priorities are for the 2017 House: ignore looming national issues, and clear the way for themselves to engage in whatever unlawful kleptocratic behavior they want.
Included in this package is also
[the measure you called about on Friday](http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-dec-30-2016)
, which will further muzzle transparency and accountability. You can mention that as well.
The House will vote on this?package TODAY. Please call?House Speaker Paul Ryan and your own House?Rep TODAY, THIS MORNING, and say:
I urge Representative ________?to speak out forcefully against the change of the non-partisan Office of Congressional ethics to the Office of Congressional Complain Review. This change effectively guts this office. At a time when transparency and ethics are more important than ever, this is a highly suspect and deeply disappointing move. The measure Paul Ryan introduced to fine members of Congress who film proceedings seems to be in the same vein?of reducing transparency and accountability. Please actively fight these measures.
I am paying attention and I want to hear Rep. ______ actively working against the passage of this move. Thank you.
If you have a Republican representative and they push back against either, you can say ""I'm telling you how this looks to your constituents. For your first acts to be to enforce ways to escape accountability does not look good, and I am watching.""

Reminder: tomorrow is your last day to make donations in the 2016 year.
But today!
Today is a work day, and we will be calling your representative on a draft bill that will be discussed and voted
on Jan 3?that's right after the holiday
,?which is why we are calling TODAY.
Paul Ryan is supporting a bill drafted by House Republicans to?fine members of the House for filming or taking photos from the floor of Congress. This is an obvious reaction to the Democrats' using their cellphones to post photos and video of their protest on the floor last July when Republicans, AGAIN, shut down discussion of?sensible gun laws?just ten days after the Pulse Nightclub shooting. The House Democrats were obliged to?use?their own devices because the Republicans had
ordered the House?s C-SPAN camera and microphone turned off.
Your task
[Call your Rep](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)
TODAY,
NOW
, and say:
""I am calling about the Republican-led bill to fine members of the House who film or take photos while on the floor. This clearly?stems from the Democrats' using their personal devices to film their gun-laws protest in July after the Republicans forced the C-SPAN camera and mic off, and
is a total affront to the transparency and honesty that American people deserve. I urge you to roundly reject this bill and to implore all your colleagues to do the same. We are counting on you to maintain our democracy.""
If the office responds by saying the law?enforces rules of decorum that already exist (or if you anticipate that will be their argument and you get VM), say:
""The Democrats were obliged to use their own?devices because the Republicans shut down the session rather than talk about the?vitally important issue of sensible gun laws. I would be glad to?talk to you about decorum when it's clear the House Republicans are willing and able to play by the rules and make good policy happen. I and many other constituents have had enough of dodging crucial issues needing attention and making excuses for it, and we are paying attention.""
If there is a VM message, leave a VM. If the box is full, try another of your rep's offices?there are generally three or ?four, one in Washington and a few around your state. If?all those are full, write a letter or email.

. Thanks, GAT!
The senate confirms cabinet picks. ?It takes 51 votes to confirm Trump?s picks. There are 48 Democrats in Senate and 52 Repubs. We need to sway a few Republicans to deny Trump?s anti-environment cabinet picks!
Print out the letter below, or use information from it to write your own letter, and snail-mail it, or phone, or email?it if you must,?to your Senators (contact info
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dqgdi1vJFRS0PpPP_KO-afjUJOpxc72RNEO1d9_5NSQ/edit#gid=0)
). Consider modifying/customizing so there is variety in what they receive.
Um, also, I haven't proofread so please do that before printing and sending kaythanks.
Dear (Senator Name):
I am contacting you to request that you vote AGAINST the confirmation of Trump?s anti-environment cabinet picks:
Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA: He is a climate change denier and he is suing the?EPA, the very agency he's been selected to head. He is a foe?of the Clean Power Plan and a strong supporter of?Oklahoma oil and gas companies, in conflict with the position he is nominated for.
Rick Perry for Energy Secretary: He is a climate change denier who?wanted to abolish the Department of Energy, the very agency he's been selected?to head.
Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State: He is?the former CEO of Exxon Mobile and a long-time friend and business associate of Putin.
Ryan Zinke for Secretary of Interior: While he wants to protect lands for hunters and sportsmen, he is a climate-change skeptic and a fracking apologist and has low?regard for the protection of?endangered species.
All four are terrible?picks for agencies designed to protect the environment and defend against climate change, for four?main reasons:
1. ?Lack of Expertise: None of them have any scientific expertise and are therefore not qualified to oversee agencies responsible for protecting our air, water, land, climate, and clean energy future. (Zinke comes closest, with an undergraduate degree in geology from 1984)
2. ?Climate Change Denial: Despite their lack of expertise, Pruitt and?Perry?deny that human-made climate change is real and Zinke questions it. An overwhelming majority of the scientific community believe there is a preponderance of evidence that climate change is human-made, and urgent problem, and can be mitigated by human activity (
[NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)
).?The vast majority of the rest of the world are concerned (
[Pew](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/18/what-the-world-thinks-about-climate-change-in-7-charts/)
), and a majority if Americans are concerned about climate change (
[Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx)
). It would be extremely irresponsible and either willfully, dangerously ignorant or willfully, dangerously malevolent?to appoint people whose beliefs are utterly odds with both scientific conclusiveness?and public opinion.
3. ?Opposition to Clean Energy: All have?made it clear that they do not support a clean energy economy, despite the fact that solar and wind power are the fastest-growing energy sources in the U.S. (
[Telegraph.co.uk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/10/25/global-renewable-power-capacity-overtakes-coal-as-500000-solar-p/)
), and despite the fact that even 75% of voters who chose Trump support a clean energy economy (
[CEN Poll](http://www.conservativeenergynetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Clean-Energy-Survey4.pdf)
)! ?Their ideas are antiquated and counter-intuitive. ?Let?s not destroy all the progress we?ve made ensuring our economic stability and a livable future for our children and grandchildren!
4. ?Ties to Fossil Fuel Industries: All four nominees?have strong ties to the fossil fuel industry. This ?represents a complete conflict of interest, directly counter to?their appointed positions.
Three quarters of animals in the planet are in grave?danger of extinction
(
[USA Today](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/19/75-percent-of-animal-species-to-be-wiped-out-in-sixth-mass-extinction)

,"Good morning!
For the rest of this week we'll go back to some earlier letters, when most of you hadn't yet joined. Today: Supporting reliable news sources!
Your task
Think about a reliable news source you use regularly and subscribe to it.?Journalism is essential to a democracy. We absolutely must find a way to re-center truth in our understandings of reality.
Do you find yourself looking at/listening to articles from any of the following? Pick that one and give it money.
Al-Jazeera
The Atlantic (analysis and opinion)
BBC
Bloomberg
The Center for Public Integrity?(nonprofit with a?mission of truth in reporting)
The Christian?Science Monitor (probably among the best balanced sources)
Columbia Journalism Review (excellent sort of meta-source looking at news and media)
The Economist (probably among the best balanced sources)
Mother Jones (unabashedly left, but solid investigative reporting)
The Nation?(unabashedly left, but solid investigative reporting)
The New York Times (left-leaning if sort of old-school editorial voice, reliable reporting)
The New Yorker?(left-leaning and?urbane but excellent?analysis and opinion)
NPR (your local?station)
PBS (your local?station)
ProPublica (nonprofit with a?mission of truth in reporting)
Reuters
The Washington Post (left-leaning editorial voice, reliable reporting)
The L.A. Times
The Wall Street Journal (right-leaning in the sense of being business/finance?oriented)
The Week (Left leaning, I think)
A local independent paper (
[do some research](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/six-critical-questions-can-use-evaluate-media-content/)
to determine its reliability)*
(You'll note my sources in these letters are sometimes things like CNN and USA Today. This is because I want to include sources?that your Trumpist relatives won't immediately dismiss if you share the informtion with them, as they might a Washington Post article.?I never use click-baity, screamy?sites as sources such as
[these](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2016/09/18/please-stop-sharing-links-to-these-sites/)
, and no one else should. Those are bad for journalism.)
If you have another five minutes
Pick one from the list above that?you've never heard of or heard of but don't know well and check it out.
Caveat
This is an incomplete list that is rife with my own interests and preferences.?I've found it?pretty?impossible to locate or compile a completely crisp bias-free list.?If you feel there are any glaring omissions shoot?me an email with your reasons.
*In Chicago the?Chicago Reporter?and the?Catalyst?have solid reporting on issues related to poverty and the Black community (Chicago Reporter) and education (Catalyst). They are both owned by the Society for?Community Renewal.?Crain's?is?a good Chicago business-focused?source.

Happy Winter Solstice! There's a lot of darkness now, but darkness is needed for growth and?regeneration.?It?will only get lighter from now on.

It contributes to the long view of keeping the president-elect's conflicts of interest and poor judgment top of mind. In the next several years, we will have to get used to delayed gratification, putting a lot of effort into things that look like they've sunk like rocks, but are in fact underwater stepping stones.
Most of our fight is going to be on the state and local levels, not the national level. It disgusts me to say it, but the Tea Party and the dreaded Koch brothers took this tack and have been unbelievably successful. Did you know

,"Hello,
One of the things we want to guard against is the normalizing of extreme and unacceptable?stances. Recently the American Medical Association announced its support for Tom Price as the head of Health and Human Services. You might recall Tom Price has fought for years to a) gut the ACA, Medicare and other policies that help vulnerable patients get medical care, and b) curtail reproductive rights in any way possible, up to and including helping lead the charge for personhood, the idea that fertilized eggs are people. (Imagine the havoc such legislation would have on couples doing IVF treatment and on the great many people who miscarry. It is absolutely nonsensical.) He has expressed disdain for women's need for accessible birth control.
A large and growing group of doctors have rejected the AMA's support and joined a new alternative medical association, the Clinician's Access Network.
[CAN representatives' words](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-protest-ama-backs-donald-trump-hhs-nominee-tom-price/)
: ""We believe that in issuing this statement of support for Dr. Price, the AMA has reneged on a fundamental pledge that we as physicians have taken ? to protect and advance care for our patients."" And in an interview, ""We are not partisan. We don?t identify with Republicans or Democrats. We identify with patients. If patients will benefit we are in full support of that. Anyone forwarding policies harmful to patients, we will fight vehemently.?
Write to the AMA at
https://www.ama-assn.org/eform/submit/contact-us .
Say:
I am extremely disappointed by the AMA's endorsement of Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. Dr. Price's enthusiastic opposition to the Affordable Care Act and efforts to curtail women's access to basic health care show that he is guided by something other than medical knowledge or scientific thinking. Dr. Price's lack of consideration for those patients who are already the most vulnerable in our society is incredibly unprofessional and will hurt a great many patients. I am mystified by your endorsement. You have lost a good deal of esteem in my eyes. What could your justification possibly be? I would appreciate a response.?Thank you.

Your action today, the last day before the holiday break for Congress, is to call Harry Reid, who is retiring, to thank him for continuing to speak out bravely against Trump's dangerous plans and even worse conflicts of interest, against FBI Director Comey's unprecedented partisan actions during the election, and against the benefits Trump gained from Russian interference with the election. If you get this after his NV office closes oh, ok, fine, go ahead and email or tweet him.

Say:
I am calling to thank Mr. Reid for continuing to speak plainly and strongly about the dangers the country faces because of Donald Trump. Trump's many conflicts and his refusal to acknowledge them, as well as his clearly benefiting from Russian interference, are serious threats to our national security and our democracy. I also want to thank Mr. Reid for speaking out against the outrageous partisan actions of James Comey. It is unbelievable that the Director of the FBI would act to sway a presidential election. I really appreciate Mr. Reid's words and hope he will continue to speak out even after his retirement. And finally, I'd like to thank Mr. Reid for his service and wish him a happy retirement!

of Republican-led Congressional committees.
Your tasks
Call any
Republican
that represents you, be that your governor, U.S. senators, or House rep, and say:
I am gravely concerned about the Russian hacks that led to both state races and the presidential race being compromised. This is WAY bigger than any partisan concerns and an investigation must not be subject to that possibility. I implore you to support an
independent
investigation. This is not a game. Our national security, our standing in the world, and our democracy are threatened. I feel personally threatened and want to see that _______ has his/her constituents' best interests on the agenda.
Call your
Democratic
representatives ? if you want to choose for the sake of time, let's go with the House, because we've focused a lot on the Senate in our calling ? and say:
I am gravely concerned about the Russian hacks that led to both state races and the presidential race being compromised. I implore you to support an

investigation. Because of the hyper-partisan atmosphere of Congress these past several years, I don't trust these committees to investigate this issue honestly or reliably. Our national security, our standing in the world, and our democracy are threatened. I am asking ______ to please push for an
independent
investigation.
Note, some are already asking for an independent investigation, including Sens. Durbin, Pelosi, and Boxer ? so, instead of the above, call them to thank them and urge them to get their colleagues on board. If you don't know where one of your reps stands, go to their website and look for a statement or press release on the subject to see whether you need to urge them to take a stand or thank them for doing so.

,"Good morning!
I initially was against this faithless elector thing ? that's where GOP electors in the electoral college go against expectations and cast their vote for a candidate other than Trump. It seemed reckless and and reflexive, propelled by the ""denial"" stage of grief. But, as Trump has given us more and more-clear reasons to be gravely concerned about his suitability, I have come to agree that this is exactly what the electoral college was for. Some electors have already pledged to vote for someone besides Trump; thirty-seven more are needed. That will then throw the vote to the House of Representatives, who will then, one would hope,?choose someone more responsible. (I
t won't be Clinton; these are GOP electors and a GOP-led House.)?Some electors face minor penalties?for voting with their conscience but
[lawyers have offered to defend them pro bono](http://Some face minor penalties for voting with their conscience but lawyers have offered to defend them pro bono.)
.
Your task is to write to some or all of the voters in the electoral college. Or rather, print out what's already written! See? Five minutes! You gotta find the envelope and stamp yourself. Or you can email, but they might have blocked unknown addresses by now. But you can try.
Go to
[this site](http://directelection.org)
, directelection.org?and just print out a letter this guy has already written for you. He even made mailing labels! Done!
Republican-elector?states (no sense writing the Democratic-elector states as they are obviously not casting their vote for Trump) are
: Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas Florida Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine (3 Dems and?1 Republican, Richard Bennet. Whatever, Maine) Michigan Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming
Or
Go to
[this site](http://asktheelectors.org)
, asktheelectors.org, to compose your thoughts. Click the red button?and it'll create an email from what you wrote in your own email program, populated with electors' email addresses. Done!
Or
Go to
[this site](https://makedemocracymatter.org)
, makedemocracymatter.org,?and get information by state for where to mail, call, or tweet. Done! This site is all about that Clinton won the popular vote which is not a valid argument given the way our system is currently set up and which is not nearly as convincing for a GOP electoral voter as pointing out the ways another Republican would be more fit than Trump. So I would recommend using the arguments below rather than the argument that Clinton won the popular vote.
Every act of resistance against Trump?is necessary. This is a powerful act of resistance.
Here is my letter:
Dear _______:
I am writing to implore you to cast your electoral vote for a Republican other than Donald Trump. The Federalist Papers say electors can judge the fitness of a president in three ways: by his qualifications or lack thereof, by whether he is a demagogue?or charlatan, and by whether he is influenced by foreign powers. Donald Trump is unfit?by these standards.
As to his qualifications,?Mr. Trump's?phone calls and tweets to and?about foreign leaders with whom we have delicate relationships
show dangerously poor judgment,
as does his lack of interest in daily?intel briefings and his baseless rejection of the work of the CIA, an institution whose job it is to keep us safe.
As to demagoguery,
Donald Trump is?the very definition of a demagogue, ""a leader who makes use of popular prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power."" His lies about himself and others?are many, and hate crimes against immigrants, Muslims, women, and other groups targeted by Mr. Trump have risen dramatically along with his rise.
Mr. Trump has impugned the press, political opponents, and indeed political friends by casting an abhorrent?mix of?lies, threats, and juvenile name-calling.
As to influence by foreign powers,?Mr. Trump is defiant about?his domestic and international?business interests, refusing to set them aside in any meaningful and binding way, and?there is already evidence that?because of this he will be enriched personally through his office of president. Dignitaries wish to stay at his hotels, for example, and real estate interests are discussed during diplomatic calls.
His children are involved with his political dealings and his business dealings both, a concerning and unprecedented conflict of interest. And finally, his admiration for Vladimir Putin and the connections to Putin both in his proposed cabinet and throughout the campaign all cause grave concern about our national security and?our very democracy.
There is no longer time to ""wait and see."" Mr. Trump has shown us amply who he is and how he would govern. The Founding Fathers would find him utterly unfit, the exact type of candidate they created the electoral college to guard?against.?I really appreciate your role in our democracy and know this must be a terribly difficult?decision. I hope you will consider taking the opportunity you have to elect a more fit person to be president. If you wish to?do so but are uncertain about any potential consequences to you, I recommend looking into the Electors' Trust,?electorstrust.org, which provides free and confidential legal support to any elector wishing to vote?their conscience.
Thank?you.
Sincerely,

,"Well good morning!
I'm sure you've heard by now that the CIA has concluded that, yes indeed, the?Russian interference during the campaign was intended to sway the election in Trump's favor. Senators
Lindsey Graham (
R-SC),
John McCain (R-AZ), Jack Reed, (D-RI), and
Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have led the charge in calling for an investigation.
Your task
Call your Senators and your?House Representative?and say:
I am calling regarding the Russian interference in our elections that the CIA has recently confirmed. This?possibility?is very alarming.?I am wondering whether?_________ has issued a statement of support?for the bipartisan call for an investigation into the matter.
If they have:
I am glad. Please thank ______ for me?for supporting the call for an investigation. I would also like to ask ________ not to back down
, and to encourage his/her colleagues to raise their voices as well. And
I want to ask?him/her too to push for an independent?bipartisan joint committee. This matter is far too important to leave vulnerable to partisan gamesmanship.
If they have not:
I would like to ask _________ to publicly support the investigation.?The possibility that?interference?affected our election is a serious danger to our democracy,?our national security, and our standing in the world. All Americans should be concerned. There is every reason to investigate and no reason not to.
If you have more time
Call?the four Senators who called for an investigation
Lindsey Graham (R-SC): DC?(202) 224-5972; Columbia, SC?(803) 933-0112
John McCain (R-AZ): ?DC?(202) 224-2235; Tucson, AZ?(520) 670-6334

,"Good morning!
Today, the first day of the last week of Congress before their holiday break, let's implore our Senators?to speak out against Trump's ghastly cabinet picks. He?literally could not have chosen?more destructive people for these cabinets. It is beyond?belief. Take a look at the Sources section for more info on each of these people.
Call both of your U.S. senators and say the following. Remember at the end to appeal to them:
I'm scared. These choices are dangerous. We are relying on you as our voice in the government.
Call and say:
""Good morning! I am calling because I am gravely concerned about the?proposed Trump Administration cabinet. Almost to a one, the people selected are bent on destroying?the?very structures they are supposed to steward. The number of billionaires in this cabinet makes it look like a Monopoly Game.?These picks look like satire. I cannot believe they are real. I'd like to give you my reasons for opposing some of the choices, but the theme here is I feel like I and my family are hens in a henhouse and Trump is introducing hungry foxes.
""The chosen head of the treasury [Steve Mnuchin]?is a Wall Street banker who was?with Goldman Sachs?for 17 years.?I can't think of a better definition of a fox in the henhouse than that.?And the guy chosen to be?Secretary of Commerce [Wilbur Ross, Jr.]?is a billionaire investor. We are back to the robber baron days.
""The expected choice for?Secretary of State, a guy who will be leading our foreign policy, is a super-rich oil man with ties to Putin?[Exxon Mobile CEO?Rex Tillerson]. This sounds made-up.
""Jeff Sessions was too racist to be appointed a judge.?He will now be attorney general, in charge of prosecutions and sentencing.
""A guy who traffics heavily in off-the-wall conspiracy theories?has been chosen as head of national security [Michael Flynn]. If any position needs?a level-headed person who can tell fact from fiction, it is the head of our national security. I understand this position is not voted on, but Senator _____'s voice?matters.?It is the only thing we have.
""The guy chosen to lead the EPA [Scott Pruitt]?is currently suing the EPA. He doesn't believe in climate change and is a champion of fossil fuels. And he will be in charge of the
environmental protection agency
.
The person chosen to protect our national parks and other natural areas is a dedicated?drilling, logging, and mining advocate [Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chosen for Secretary of Interior...She is also a climate change denier, natch].
""The proposed secretary of education [Betsy DeVos]?is a billionaire who has spent gigantic sums of money to push for a voucher system and has never taught, studied education, or even sent her kids to public school. She is a huge advocate of providing public money for Christian schools. And she is in charge of our
public school system
.
""For Health and Human Services we have a guy who hates the ACA and holds interests in pharmaceutical, medical device,?and health insurance companies, the very companies he will be charged with overseeing.?This is an untenable conflict of interest. Tom Price is also key player in the unscientific and bizarre personhood?movement.
""The person chosen to protect the rights and opportunities of workers and job-seekers [Andy Puzder as Secretary of Labor]?has violated employment and hourly laws at half of his restaurants and spoken out against basic workers' rights such as sick leave.
""Please. These choices defy reason. This cabinet will be playing with hundreds of millions of people's lives, here and abroad. What unifies these choices is a frankly cruel disregard for everyday Americans like me. We have no voice except through our elected representatives, so, please, I am imploring Senator _____ to do everything (s)he can to mitigate these crazy fox-in-the-henhouse choices. We are counting on him/her and we are scared.""

,"Good afternoon!
A pep talk: a million bitty flashlights
If you are like me, you sometimes struggle with believing that your small actions are actually
doing
anything. What difference does one phone call or one lousy entry on a website make? Sometimes I feel like I'm struggling to light an endless fall down Alice's rabbit hole with a bitty little pen flashlight.
But we must keep faith, and we must keep paying attention.?Each of us has a bitty little flashlight to shine. If there are thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of us all shining our bitty little flashlights together, the dangerous nonsense that has seized our democracy will wither and fade under the light.
Of course, if you want to wield a bigger flashlight, there are many opportunities to get involved in politics and/or activism in increments greater than five minutes. This newsletter is focused on small actions, so I don't touch on those here. But if you email me I can suggest some ideas to research.
So! Your task.
It's Sunday evening. Focus your thoughts for the week ahead by going to the website of an organization you already support and doing one of their online action items, such as sharing your story or signing an online petition. If you don't know where to go, here are some ideas:
ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union: https://www.aclu.org/action
Earthjustice, defending the environment: http://earthjustice.org/action
Electronic Frontier Foundation,?defending civil liberties in the digital world:?https://act.eff.org
Planned Parenthood Action, defending reproductive rights and access to reproductive health care: https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/act

,"Happy Saturday!
You may recall calling?Lamar Smith, the head of the House Science Committee who doesn't believe in science. One glaring example is his active work against acknowledging and?addressing climate change (see sources). ?Here are two two-minute things you can do on the weekend:
Task 1
Thank meteorologist?Danielle Banks and?the?Weather Channel for publicly?rebuking Breitbart?when Breitbart?misused Weather Channel graphics?in a story falsely?denying climate change.
[Watch their video and read their article](https://weather.com/news/news/breitbart-misleads-americans-climate-change)
, titled ""Note to Breitbart: Earth Is Not Cooling, Climate Change Is Real and Please Stop Using Our Video to Mislead Americans."" You go Danielle and Weather Channel!
I can't find a contact email for the Weather Channel, unfortunately. The best I can find is tweeting them:
@weatherchannel
@DanielleBanksTV
Sample message:
Thank you for setting @BrietbartNews straight point by point on #climatechange. Go #science!
If you find contact info let me know! I personally would rather write them, but their ""feedback"" link just goes to canned FAQs.
Task 2
Go to
[lamarsmith.house.gov](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Flamarsmith.house.gov%2F&h=hAQFMyW_WAQEveKPhA-VSw-9EY9HJvRcAMe3hRIjgdgoNxA&enc=AZOzU2VBToJ64W0HtmRxJSmwGZrHfYBJFpgTt_e4MpXwxVEnZRShnhDXWV9rOppO6hF15bYk3lLvlQgAXJGm75oMYYjCuOAnLj2l1UE-uHC5hD_GlR4MSYeELqw4jL_LTzYqtfDTV4JV6F5a06cXhQWvCApnUPcFxmxR5sdi5T-UN-1e_iIODBifw6YnLvjGks0&s=1)
and select as Congress' priority for the year ""Other."" Then fill in something like?""Addressing the reality of?climate change through concrete measures such as abiding by the Paris agreement,?supporting development of renewal energy, and prioritizing science-based ways to mitigate the dangers.""

Also - did any of you talk with your reps' offices yesterday? How'd it go? What'd you learn?",2017-05-19 00:43:22.897874,,,"Your five-minute action item today: Dec. 10, 2016",Parsed https://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes for training data,Small Steps for a Big Impact,[],FiveMinutes,[],[],http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-dec-10-2016
,"Good morning!
Today's task is a bit different. I was reminded yesterday during my call to outgoing Senator Kirk (R-IL) that positive reinforcement is powerful. I began my call by thanking Sen. Kirk for his service, saying I often did not agree with him on policy but that I appreciated his efforts and his integrity. The aide was super thankful.?When I mentioned the second reason for my call - to express my grave concern about Tom Price - the aide enthusiastically noted my concerns and asked if I had concerns about other picks. Did I ever!! I went down the list and he noted them all. He thanked me and?talked?about the importance calling, saying otherwise the Senator and his staff don't know what people are thinking and they really want to know, etc.?I was?not meaning to?butter anyone up - thanking Kirk?was one of the talking points on my agenda. But it certainly seemed helpful!
Your task
Let's wait til Monday or Tuesday to call about the dangerous unsuitability of most of Trump's cabinet picks (we don't want your words forgotten over the weekend). But today, let's pause to develop our calling game. Your task is to call your U.S. House and Senate reps and get to know how we can best communicate with them.
Get some paper and pencil or its digital equivalent. When the person answers, note their name. Then say:
Hi, ____. My name is _____. In the wake of this election, I've decided to get more involved in the democratic process. You'll be hearing from me a lot - in fact you already have - so I thought I'd call to introduce myself, and learn from you how I can be a good constituent.
Is there a best day or time to call _______'s office to give my thoughts on a particular issue or bill? Is there a day or time to avoid?
What can I do to make sure my opinion is?heard? What are some things I should avoid?
How do you process these calls? Do you tally pro/con, deliver a daily or weekly summary, or something else? What if I'm the only person who is calling about an issue?
What are some other ways I can engage besides calling?
Thanks so much! Have a great weekend.

,"Good morning!
Your task
Trump has named as his choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon whose major priorities are restricting reproductive health choices and dismantling the ACA, or Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). More details below ""How to call."" Your task is to ask your senators to represent their constituents by speaking out against this appointment and working to keep this extreme ideologue out of the cabinet.
How to call
If you don't have your reps' numbers in your phone,
[find 'em](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/trumps-vow-repeal-obamacare-spurs-womens-rush-get-birth-control/)
and put 'em in now once and for all.
Please call your Senators and tell them:
[If they are Democrats] I am extremely concerned about Tom Price's appointment as head of Health and Human Services. His strong support of the fringe notion of personhood and 0% rating from Planned Parenthood are horrifying. I am also concerned about his enthusiasm for repealing the ACA, health care that millions and millions of Americans rely on. I am relying on Senator ______ to stand strong with his/her constituents by calling Tom Price out as an extreme and damaging choice and, when the time comes, by voting against his appointment. I want to hear and see Senator ____ actively fighting to keep ideologues like Tom Price out of this administration. Can I count on him/her?
[If they are Republicans]
I am extremely concerned about Tom Price's appointment to head Health and Human Services. His extremist views around personhood simply do not represent how most Americans feel. I am also concerned about his enthusiasm for repealing the ACA, health care that millions and millions of Americans rely on. The ACA needs to be shored up, not destroyed. Even many Republican-led states now see how valuable the ACA has been. It is very important for Republicans to push back on extremists in the Trump cabinet. Can I count on Senator ______ to speak out against Tom Price, and when the time comes, to vote against his appointment?
More information
Tom Price was a key figure in the ""personhood"" movement, in which people tried to get fertilized eggs legally declared humans. It didn't work, naturally, since this stance is total nonsense (what do couples doing IVF do with multiple fertilized eggs? How will we know if a woman is experiencing a period or a blastocyst's suicide?) and utterly unscientific. His was an ideological, medically irresponsible push meant to punish people seeking abortions. And now he's going to head all health care initiatives for the U.S.
Price is also hell-bent on repealing the ACA. The ACA needs changes, mostly because insurance companies have done their best to make things difficult for it and us. But eliminating the ACA will cause medical suffering and economic panic. For example, patients needing a lot of care will likely end up in ""high-risk"" pools, which have a dismal record in states that tried it, and?it will likely get much more difficult for many people to access or afford birth control.
So Tom Price has something for everyone, if by ""everyone"" you mean white supremacists, men's rights jerks, Pence, and Trump. Trump has mentioned at some points he wants to make changes to the ACA and at other points that he wants to repeal it entirely; his choice of HHS Secretary reveals his con.
[Editorial note: The same people who say the ACA, and regulations of any kind, are Big Government are the very people who want to legislate people's reproductive rights out of existence.]

Paul Ryan's Speaker of the House number was incorrect.?The correct number as well as a script correction is?in bold, below.

This is how conspiracy theorists work. They make an outlandish claim, then demand that others prove it's NOT true. ""Hey! - your best friend is an alien sent here to gather information on you. Oh, you don't think so? PROVE it's not true."" See how that works?

,"Good Monday to you!
Your action today is concerning the ill-advised phone calls our president-elect has made to leaders of foreign states. Spread the word on this one to your friends and associates?I haven't seen this call?to action in other sources. My thinking on it is we want our reps in Washington, both Democrats and Republicans, to know we're watching them and?we expect them to stand up to dangerous ignorance.
Your task
Call the chairs of the House Foreign Relations committee and/or of the Senate Foreign Relations committee?and say:
Hello, my name is ______ and I'm calling ______ in his capacity as Republican/Democratic chair of the House/Senate Foreign Relations committee. I am extremely concerned about president-elect Trump's ill-advised phone calls to various foreign leaders, which are out of step with decades of careful policy and relationship work. I ask that the members of the committee please condemn such behavior and offer some explanation to both the president-elect and to us, the public, as to how this behavior could affect our national security and our safety.
How to call
House Foreign Affairs Committee leaders:
Ed Royce - R (CA):?(202) 225-4111
Eliot Engel - D (NY):?(202) 225-2464
House Foreign Affairs Committee General Number:?(202) 225-5021
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations leaders:
Chair Bob Corker (R- TN) (202) 224-4651
Ranking member Ben Cardin (D-MD):?(202) 224-4524
Senate Foreign Relations Committee General Number:?(202) 224-4651
Got another minute?
Consider calling Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), who is on the Foreign Relations committee and who rebuked Trump's calls as signaling a major policy pivot without a plan, to
thank him f
or speaking out:?(202) 224-4041
And calling?Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), who is also on the Foreign Relations committee and who advised Trump to rely on advice from professionals so as not to stumble into breaking decades of precedent, to
thank him
for speaking out:?(202) 224-5042
More information
Here are his diplomacy blunders from just the past few days (sources below):
He called to chat with Rodrigo Duterte, the hard-right leader of the Phillipines, who has called Obama a ""son of a whore,"" made challenging remarks about China in regards to U.S. policy,?and centered his ""war on drugs"" policy around killing suspected drug dealers?without any trial or other process?(as a result?4500 people have been shot and killed in the streets).
He called to chat with Nawaz?Sharif, Pakistan's leader4. You might recall Pakistan and India have some issues with each other, and that Pakistan and the U.S.'s relationship is fraught and?complicated. Trump's call has been called reckless, bizarre, and ignorant.
He called Taiwan's new leader, Tsai Ing-wen. You may recall China is pretty uptight about Taiwan and that the U.S. and China's relationship is
complicated and delicate

,"Good morning!
Yesterday the House Committee On Space, Science, and Technology tweeted a link to an article by Breitbart (!!!) denying the reality of climate change (!!!). A screen shot is attached.
Your tasks:
1) Tweet the
House Committee On Space, Science, and Technology and tell them ?ignorance?and hate are not appropriate in our legislature, or they are a menace to society and should leave any committee with the word ""science"" in it, or denying reality doesn't make it go away and using hate propaganda to do it is even worse, ?or?some such tweet. Here was mine:
Denying science and supporting a white-supremacist hate rag are dangerous and irresponsible actions. @HouseScience, shame on you.
2) Call Lamar Smith, the chair of the committee:?202-225-4236.?Say something like:
I am calling because I'm gravely?concerned about the tweet sent out by the Space, Science, and Technology Committee, of which Mr. Smith is chair. This tweet cited Breitbart News, which is not news but a hate site for white supremacists,?and?denied?climate change. As Mr. Smith should well know as chair of the science committee, weather is not climate and the evidence of catastrophic climate?change is overwhelming, so this tweet was made out of either ignorance or deceit, and both of those options are extremely troubling.
2a) I was told (nicely) that?Lamar Smith's office is not responsible for Science Committee tweets and would I like to speak to the Science Committee Office. I replied (nicely) Yes I would, but also Mr. Smith?is the chair and should know what his committee is doing. Here is the Science Office number:?202-225-6371
3) If your rep
[is a member](https://science.house.gov/about/members)
, whether Dem or Repub,?and tell them of your concern.
[Here](https://science.house.gov)
is the Science Committee's?website. They refer?to the Paris Agreement, which the whole world signed on to, as a waste of money and to?Obama's signing onto it as ""unlawful.""
Editorial note: I seriously cannot believe this is real. Is this real? We are tweeting our House committee on science to tell them not to use a white supremacist source to spread anti-science?

So why ever would he be dragging his feet?
Chaffetz claims it is because Trump?is not yet president. Do you think he would have extended this courtesy to Clinton?
Your task
Call Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the committee's lead:?(202) 225-7751. They might interrupt you early on and say you need to call the Oversight Committee Office. Fine, then:?(202) 225-5074.
Say: My name is ____ and I am calling Mr. Chaffetz in his capacity as the chair of the House Oversight Committee. I am extremely concerned about Mr. Trump's many blatant conflicts of interest that he has already capitalized on. These include his involvement with a Trump Tower in Argentina, his wanting to influence wind farms in Scotland, and his children sitting in with him on business meetings as well as matters of state. It is the job of the Committee to investigate these conflicts as well as any conflicts going forward.
Call Mark Meadows (R- NC) who chairs the Subcommittee on government operations and use the script above:?(202) 225-6401
Call Elijah Cummings (D- MD), the Democratic lead, and thank him for demanding this investigation:
(202) 225-4741

Then tweet, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook the hell out of that statement. In Facebook groups, bulletin boards, or other shared digital spaces? Post there! Remind your friends, family, coworkers, and clients that today is #GivingTuesday; make it a norm in your circle to give and to share where you gave.
Where to give
Here are a few ideas...
Give locally. Change starts at home. Think about the issues and practices you feel are most threatened by Trumpism and find your local?equivalent: a neighborhood women's health clinic; a group that helps settle refugees; a local Muslim community center; your region's wetlands?protection group.
[This website](http://www.givethefuture.org)

More info and sources
Trump is freely mixing his private business holdings with his responsibilities as a public officer. For example, Ivanka Trump, who is also deeply involved in the Trump family business holdings, attended meetings with foreign leaders alongside her father, a wholly unprecedented action that has no reasonable rationale. Foreign dignitaries are staying at Trump hotels in order to curry favor with him. Trump has asked Brexit leader Nigel Farage to oppose proposed windmills in Scotland because Trump feels they will mar one of his golf properties.
It is completely unethical and, well, kleptocratic to personally enrich oneself through one's public office of president.
Unfortunately, these conflicts are not specifically illegal (though the foreign dealings could be argued to violate the
[Emoluments Clause](http://time.com/4579979/emoluments-clause-constitution-donald-trump/)
of the Constitution).

Background
Trump has chosen Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist. Steve Bannon is the executive chair of Breitbart, an online media outlet beloved by white supremacists. Under Bannon's direction, Breitbart's content went from merely conservative to being a mouthpiece of the fringe ultra-right-wing (the ""alt-right""). (Sources and some chilling video?below.)
Your task
Don't worry?FiveMinutes won't ask you to call your reps
every
day. But yes, today is another rep-calling day.
Call your U.S. senator and representative and ask if they have denounced Steve Bannon as the president-elect's pick for his chief strategist.
If they have, thank them
for standing up for American values.
If they have not, demand
they do so. Trump could not have picked a stronger signal that his America is a white Christian America led by men alone.
This appointment is not normal.
This America that Trump and Bannon want must not take seed.

is a list of U.S. Reps who have denounced Bannon, although it's a week old by now. If your rep is on this list, please
still call to thank
him/her. It's important that our reps know these actions are seen and appreciated. My House rep's staff said ""Oh my God thank you so much for calling we need more calls like this!"" when I called to thank him. I could not find a similar list of Senators;

ACTION #1
Background
Trump has made clear through his choice?of EPA transition lead that he was not just trying to grab attention?when he denounced climate change as a hoax. The person who will lead the development of?Trump's EPA administration is?Myron Ebell (pronounced ""Ee-bul""), one of the world's most prominent and outspoken climate-change critics. (More information sources are?at the end of this email.)
Your task
Call your representatives?and ask?them if you can count on them to?denounce the appointment of Myron?Ebell as Trump's EPA transition lead.
Use some or all of these talking points:
Climate change is an imminent threat to the world's people, as well as the plants, animals, and atmosphere we all rely on to live. The entire world has recognized this threat and is taking steps together to face it.
Wishing something weren't true doesn't make it go away. Playing with this threat as a political issue?is incredibly dangerous and inappropriate; insisting it doesn't exist shows an absence of leadership.
This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is an?issue that will greatly?affect your children and mine?and it is real.
We will emerge stronger if we accept the challenge of climate change and meet it. Jobs and whole industries can be developed in environmental and energy-conservation technology fields.
This is not something Congress?votes on, but we need to hear their voices insisting on reason and reality.

Action #1: More information and sources
Myron Ebell believes the threat of climate change is massively exaggerated,?that the Obama administration's?Clean Power Plan for greenhouse gases is illegal, and that Obama's?participation in the Paris climate agreement
is unconstitutional. He helped destroy Congress's?2009 attempt to create cap-and-trade legislation (sources below).
If you wish,?sign this Sierra Club petition as well. But calling your own representatives, and then spreading the word, is probably more effective, so steel yourself and make the call. It will just take a few minutes and the person you speak to will be very nice.?Petition:?https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/National?actionId=AR0060378&id=70131000001iOuIAAU

He says here that?warmer temperatures will make colder regions more habitable and that hot weather will only kill people who are close to death already. This?unbelievably?simplistic?understanding of climate change does not take into account how ecosystem collapses and changes in landforms and waterways?will affect our safety, food, and water supply, and will create social upheavals as?populations?become climate refugees through loss of land, food, and?water sources.",2017-05-19 00:44:35.962377,,,"Your five-minute action item today: Nov. 21, 2016",Parsed https://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes for training data,Small Steps for a Big Impact,[],FiveMinutes,[],[],http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-nov-21-2016
,"Good morning!
Your action item today is?on the Affordable Care Act (ACA, also called?Obamacare).?It needs to be strengthened, not dismantled.?Paul Ryan is currently conducting a phone survey on who supports the ACA. You don't have to speak directly to anyone, just call, press 2 to ""give your opinion about the healthcare law,""?and then after the recorded message about Ryan's opposition to the ACA, press 1 to indicate your support for the law or 2 to indicate non-support (Ryan's position). BE PATIENT as it may take quite some time to connect ?over a minute. You will hear just silence and wonder if something went awry ??just stay on the phone and you will get the recorded message.?Phone number: (202) 225-3031.
That's it!

,"Hello! Today's five-minute agenda:
1) It's widely understood that overly partisan ""news"" and outright fake ""news"" swayed this election a great deal.* Look at

out for a different opinion. On that, though, my take is that, while there is a difference between heavily slanted and sensationalist ""news"" and actual fake news, this distinction is not hugely important when it comes to getting our deeply divided two realities to merge. In fact, heavily slanted news is insidious and harder to call out; it's harder to get people to see they are not getting the full picture.",2017-05-19 00:44:36.443796,,,Your five-minute action item today: November 19,Parsed https://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes for training data,Small Steps for a Big Impact,[],FiveMinutes,[],[],http://tinyletter.com/FiveMinutes/letters/your-five-minute-action-item-today-november-19
