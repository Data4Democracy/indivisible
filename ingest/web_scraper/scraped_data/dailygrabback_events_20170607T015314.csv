Last week our illustrious President decided to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement forged to fight climate change. This is despite the fact that his best friends in Russia elected this year to participate. In a tweet about the move Trump stated ?I was elected by voters of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve US interests."" What Trump failed to realize before tweeting is that the voters in Pittsburgh overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton and their mayor, Bill Peduto, was having none of that nonsense. He clapped back, hard. ?As the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & our future.? Holy covfefe!

Recently the term ?TERF? has been circulating social media, partly because of comments by prominent feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. TERF stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminism, and it?s an extremist movement that seeks to erase and silence trans women by claiming they are not ?real women.?

[donate to the NAACP](http://www.naacp.org/legal-department/naacp-legal-history/)
in support of their calling for racist Karl Oliver to step down from the Mississippi state legislature.
In a May 17th Facebook post, Rep. Oliver (R-Winona) called for the lynching of Louisiana leaders who take down confederate monuments. Not only is the statement clearly racist, it is a direct threat to those Louisiana leaders who called for the monuments to be taken down. Oliver?s statements are an invitation to those who agree with him to cause bodily harm to Louisiana lawmakers, much like
[45 did during his Presidential Election rallies](http://mashable.com/2016/03/12/trump-rally-incite-violence/#60WxPAE6Riqb )
when protesters annoyed him.
Oliver?s Facebook post, which was later removed, read:
""The destruction of these monuments, erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans, is both heinous and horrific. If the, and I use this term extremely loosely, 'leadership' of Louisiana wishes to, in a Nazi-ish fashion, burn books or destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY, they should be LYNCHED! Let it be known, I will do all in my power to prevent this from happening in our State.""
Karl Oliver is a first time lawmaker, and the district that he presides over just so happens to include the town of Money, where, in 1955, Emmett Till was kidnapped and murdered. Oliver has

"May 30, 2017","Your DGB for today is to contact your local representatives, if applicable, or a representative in a nearby state and demand they remove all Confederate monuments.
New Orleans has been in the news lately for removing all of the Confederate monuments in their city. Many applauded this move, but some fought against it, even forming a tiki torch brigade and trying to intimidate the workers removing the statues. We applaud New Orleans, but the
[United States has a serious Confederate monument problem](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/22/confederate-monuments-new-orleans-charlottesville-removal-race-civil-war/101870418/)
.
There are more than 700 monuments, spanning 31 states, and some in states that fought against the Confederacy. We have even seen 35 monuments erected since 2000.
The removal of monuments across New Orleans has sparked a national discussion on where Confederate monuments fit into our nation and it?s history. In a
[speech](http://pulsegulfcoast.com/2017/05/transcript-of-new-orleans-mayor-landrieus-address-on-confederate-monuments)
on why he removed the monuments, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu stated:
?
These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.
After the Civil War, these statues were a part of that terrorism as much as a burning cross on someone?s lawn; they were erected purposefully to send a strong message to all who walked in their shadows about who was still in charge in this city.?
We are asking you to contact the Mayors of cities that have Confederate monuments and implore them to follow the lead of Mayor Mitch Landrieu and remove the monuments. This
[list of monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monuments_and_memorials_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)

Check any comments section on a story about Trump?s presidency and possible downfall and you?ll see numerous dismissals of the ?fake news?. Here are some actual comments from Facebook on a CNN article about Trump attempting to compromise Comey:
?
This obsession about the alledged (sic) Trump's ties with Russia can only be explained as a paranoia.USA is obviously in a state of internal conflict and this will not be solved easy.The Russian card is a pure propaganda.?
?CNN and MSNBC have declared war on our duly elected President. Who else's thinks it's time to start using social and mainstream media to identify seditious activity and start filling up the FEMA camps??
?Says who? Another fake unnamed source! CNN and their destroy America, destroy the first and second amendment, destroy our constitution, destroy the electoral college via their brainwashed cult followers!!?
These comments are why we HATE reading comments sections. There were hundreds more like this and that?s a huge problem. Many people just don?t know how to spot fake news anymore and when actual news breaks, they claim it?s fake because it doesn?t fit the narrative that has been fed to them by websites like Breitbart.
This is where The News Literacy Project comes in. NLP aims to teach middle and high school students how to spot fake news, be informed and engaged citizens, and encourages them to share and produce their own fair, accurate, and responsible news content. We encourage you to reach out to local schools and ask that they work NLP into their curriculum, either by offering an after school program or a classroom or virtual classroom program. You can also donate and support them on their website linked above. Fake news is an issue for both parties, and now more than ever it is important to learn how to spot it. We want you to check out
[FactCheck.org?s article](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/how-to-spot-fake-news/)

Recently, the Trump administration ordered a halt to the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission, which has overseen the management of the 44,000 acre preserved land since 1961. While the organization does not make policy, their oversight is a layer of protection for the forty miles of unspoiled beaches, marshes, and cultural landmarks. Under Trump, and Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, the conservation of public lands is, at best,
[a low priority](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-will-become-of-federal-public-lands-under-trump)
. At worst, our federal government could be moving toward land transfer deals and commercial interests in some of the places that truly make our country great.
Congressman Keating is a Democrat and a conservationist, so we just need to let him know that we care and there will be public pressure to help him preserve the beautiful open spaces in his district.

The Executive Branch is barreling towards a foregone conclusion that our country has seen before. Many of us weren?t even a twinkle in our parents? eyes during the Nixon administration, so here?s a quick Watergate rundown: Basically, Nixon tried to hang on to power for as long as possible by compounding his criminal acts and removing anyone who got too close to the truth about them. He didn?t actually fire his FBI Director. Louis Patrick Gray was complicit in the burglary coverup and his Assosciate FBI Director ended up being Deep Throat, which was pretty much the craziest thing that had ever happened in US politics until November 8, 2016. By the time Nixon?s dumpster of an administration was fully engulfed in the flames of scandal, the investigation was far enough along that a Special Prosecutor had been appointed. This man was Archibald Cox. When Nixon fired him in an event known as The Saturday Night Massacre, it was a public relations nightmare. Things really spiraled after that, and we all know the ending.

Additionally, you?ll be sure to pressure your representatives to push for a special prosecutor.

about what JDoe does and why it?s so important.
A few of facts about sexual assault are that one in five women and children will be a victim of sexual assault. Although most victims feel like they are alone, they aren?t. 90% of sexual offenders are repeat offenders. (Our president even implied that he grabbed more than one woman.) You can report your own sexual assault on JDoe or one you witnessed, and it?s all anonymous, if you want it to be. Having resources like anonymous reporting and legal help in place makes victims 300% more likely to report a sexual assault. Check out their website, as well as their blog, to learn more:

[ReMoved](https://www.removedfilm.com/)
for Foster Care Awareness Month (follow the link and click ?watch?.
)
ReMoved is a film directed by Nathanael Matanick and is utilized by social service agencies throughout the nation as a training tool for social workers, foster parents, and service providers. The film is poignant and painful and we?re asking you to watch the film because it captures the reality of the child protection system in a way that is more powerful than words can convey. The film is approximately 30 minutes long and has two parts. Yes, it?s more than the usual 5 minute DGB time commitment, but it?s worth it. If you feel it may be triggering for you, please don?t watch, but if you choose to, remember to bring the tissues.
Some statistics to keep in mind as you watch the film:
Over 400,000 children are currently in foster care in the United States
More than half of children in foster care are in the process of being reunited with their biological families
43% of youth in foster care do not graduate high school
Over half of youth are unemployed within three years of aging out of foster care
25% of youth become homeless within 2 years of aging out of foster care
Girls who have been in foster care are 2.5 times more likely to be pregnant by the time they are 19

"May  4, 2017","Your DGB for today is to call your representatives and object to the wall.
We all have heard that Trump is building a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it. It was one of the major campaign platforms the manchild ran on, but if anyone has ever traveled to a border state, they?d know that a wall is pretty much impossible to build, given the terrain alone. If you have never seen the border of Mexico and the US, take a Texan DGB Staffer?s word that it would be quite the feat to build a wall on our southern border, not to mention the toll it would take on our budget, now that we all know Mexico is NOT going to pay for the wall. (Like anyone believed they would in the first place.)
Building a wall is not only a 7th century solution for a 21st century ?problem.? It also enacts imminent domain, which we thought republicans were against, but we know racism drives people to forget their core beliefs. Not to mention it is an ecological nightmare, not just for border states, but for flora and fauna across the globe, as well as causing problems like
[flooding and polluting local drinking water](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/25/525383494/trump-s-proposed-u-s-mexico-border-wall-may-violate-1970-treaty)
. Mexico also claims it breaks a 1970 Boundary Treaty, and they will go to court over it.
Over 100 endangered species live along the 1300 mile expanse of border and rely on a somewhat uninhibited border crossing. Animals like deer, mountain lion, ocelot, and jaguar are already impacted by the fences currently in place. A wall would do so much more damage, but many environmental scientists are afraid to discuss it given the current anti-science climate in DC. You can read more about the impact on animals in this

So what can you do? We are urging you to call, visit, e-mail, tweet, or even send a carrier pigeon to your representatives and urge them to say no to Donald Trump and his boyish dreams of a wall. You may even suggest that they give him a Lego set so he can fulfill his wall-building fantasies without causing environmental devastation to the people living along the border, as well as the animals who need to pass it for their existence.

Have you been a victim or perpetrator of the old gaffe where one person assumes that a woman is pregnant and then turns out to be wrong? The heart of those terribly awkward exchanges is the notion that it?s totally cool to turn an observation regarding someone?s body into speech. It?s actually rude, can be very hurtful, and contributes to toxic notions about food/eating, weight, and beauty. That example is an obvious one but it?s still not okay, even in other instances. What if your coworker looks thinner and you want to compliment them? Nope. You may have no idea why they have lost weight or even that they actually wanted to.

[Earth Day](http://www.earthday.org/earthday/)

The themes this year center around environmental and climate literacy. What does that mean? Through education we can learn how to make decisions that positively impact the environment and our relationship to the earth. The Earth Day Campaign Network has made a commitment to ensure that no student graduates high school without being environment and climate literate; ready to enact positive change in order to preserve our world.
In addition to increasing literacy, several campaigns are launching around the globe to protect forests, register new voters, make greener cities, protect endangered species, and address climate change. Support, donate, or educate yourself about these initiatives
[here](http://www.earthday.org/campaigns/)

The most publicized and visible activity this year is, of course, the

When something as horrific as what is going on in Syria happens, people tend to say things like ?If only there was something I could do? or ?I wish I could help.? The truth is that you can, but sometimes it takes a little work or investigation. Today we are doing the work for you.
First, you need to understand what is going on in Syria. To do that, you can read
[this breakdown](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/16979186)
of how it all started.
Next, you need to learn about some of the organizations that are helping out in Syria. DGB recommends watching the documentary
[White Helmets](https://www.netflix.com/title/80101827)
, available on Netflix.
It?s only 40 minutes and it?s about the first responders putting their lives at risk every day to rescue victims from the rubble of this war torn country. Lastly, you need to find a way to actually help. If you have the means, you can donate to

Manterruption is described as ?a behavior when men interrupt women unnecessarily. It stops women from expressing themselves and has a deep impact on their studies, careers, and personal lives.? It is so prevalent in our society that men often don?t even realize that they?re doing it, and women are often seen as the rude ones for correcting them.

Today we are asking you to go to the

website and watch the short video with clips of famous women being interrupted.
How could anyone forget Kanye?s infamous line of ?Imma let you finish, but?? Yeah, that was classic manterrupting, heightened to a Kanye level. After watching the video, explore some facts on their website (like men dominate 75% of conversations during conference calls) and then download the app. DGB used it for some research and discovered a certain spouse manterrupted ten times in a 15 minute conversation about this week's plans. Men can also download the app. You choose your gender and then do a series of voice recognition tests. So if you are a man, you can see if you are a chronic manterrupting offender and work on ways to improve yourself and amplify female voices.

Thomas, who attends Dartmouth College, reached her initial $10,000 goal, but has expanded for a new stretch goal of $25,000.

Below is a short list of after school clubs that DGB members have participated in or heard about:
[Bedtime Math & Crazy 8s Math Club](http://bedtimemath.org/ )
: All proceeds from the Bedtime Math Books go to support the Crazy 8s after school math clubs. All materials and lesson plans are free.

[Girls on the Run](https://www.girlsontherun.org/ )
: This after school club focuses on girls in grades 3-8, and allows parents and teachers to get fit with daughters, grandaughters, nieces, and other school-aged girls after school hours. What a great way to spend some time together.
[Let Me Run:](http://www.letmerun.org/ )

Overwinter your lawn. Here?s a perfect excuse not to rake those leaves! Leaving your grass unclipped and those leaves in place, leaves a natural habitat for bees, particularly bumblebees to overwinter.

Always turn taps off tightly so they do not drip.
Promptly repair any leaks in and around your taps. (One leak can waste several thousand liters of water per year.)
Use an aerator and/or a water flow-reducer attachment on your tap to reduce your water usage.
When hand-washing dishes, never run water continuously. Wash dishes in a partially filled sink and then rinse them using the spray attachment on your tap.
If you have an electric dishwasher, use it only to wash full loads, and use the shortest cycle possible. Many dishwashers have a conserver/water-miser cycle.
When brushing your teeth, turn the water off while you are actually brushing. Use short bursts of water for cleaning your brush. (This saves about 80% of the water normally used.)
When washing or shaving, partially fill the sink and use that water rather than running the tap continuously. (This saves about 60% of the water normally used.) Use short bursts of water to clean razors.
Use either low-flow shower heads or adjustable flow-reducer devices on your shower heads. (They reduce flow by at least 25%.)
You can reduce water usage by 40% to 50% by installing low-flush toilets.
Wash only full loads in your washing machine.
Use the shortest cycle possible for washing clothes, and use the ""suds-saver"" feature if your machine has one.
Use only cleaning products that will not harm the environment when they are washed away after use. Look for ""environmentally friendly"" products when shopping.
Lawns and gardens require only 5 millimeters of water per day during warm weather. Less is needed during spring, fall, or cool weather.
Water lawns every three to five days, rather than for a short period every day. In warm weather, apply 5 millimeters of water for each day since the last watering.
Water during the cool part of the day, in the morning or evening. Do not water on windy days.
Do not over-water in anticipation of a shortage. Soil cannot store extra water.
Use shut-off timers or on-off timers, if possible. Do not turn on sprinklers and leave for the day.

"March 13, 2017","Your DGB for today is to obtain the skills and tools to become a better good samaritan.
Today is Good Samaritan Day, and we all remember the iconic finale to Seinfeld where the cast witnesses a man getting carjacked at gunpoint, and instead of helping him out, they stand around and crack jokes about it, all while Kramer films the entire thing. The victim notices and and they all end up in jail under the brand new ?Duty to Rescue Law.? If you haven?t watched it, oops...spoiler alert, but the episode was used to highlight a phenomenon known as the bystander effect. The
[bystander effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/bystander-effect)
is the aversion to helping others in an emergency situation when there are other people around.
Some think it?s because we take social cues from others before acting or because we are waiting for someone with more expertise to step in.
Today we are asking you to break out of the bystander effect and be prepared for situations that may arise. There are three specific things you can do to be prepared to be a good samaritan. The first is to become comfortable delegating. Instead of asking someone for help, take charge in a situation by saying ?you, in the hat, call 911.? Taking the lead and stepping in will make others feel more confident in helping out. You can learn more tips on bystander intervention
[here](https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/2/18/bystander-intervention?rq=bystander)
.
The second thing to do is to learn the skills necessary to possibly save a life. Get your
[CPR or First Aid certificate](https://www.nationalcprfoundation.com/)
to help someone in need while you wait for the professionals to arrive.
And third, purchase a
[first aid kit](https://smile.amazon.com/First-Aid-Only-All-purpose-299-Piece/dp/B000069EYA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1488245844&sr=8-3&keywords=first+aid+kit)
to keep in your car or bag.
You never know if you?ll need it for you, your family, or a stranger, but it?s always good to have on hand for bumps and bruises or more severe injuries.

"March 11, 2017","Your DGB for today is to learn a little something about Muslim-American art and culture.
It has become glaringly obvious in America, particularly since 9/11, that Muslim-Americans have had their faith politicized and demonized by outsiders, their narrative stolen, their identity collectivized and imposed upon them, and their uniqueness and American-ness silenced. Their commonality is their faith, but the identity of Muslim-Americans as individuals knows no boundaries.
When sharing what it means to be a Muslim-American, there can be little that is more powerful than artistic expression; whether it be written, visual, musical or culinary, to name a few. In an effort to connect their faith with their American identity and then share that message with others, Muslim-American artists have carved themselves out a voice in the cultural narrative of this country.

[music](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2012/12/17/48323/muslim-americans-bridging-communities-through-art-and-music/)
of Omar Chakaki and Nizar Wattad - country music is not just for good ole? white, southern cowboys anymore.
These words by Michel Moushabeck
are a powerful reminder of why those outside the faith need to delve into learning about this dynamic religion and those who practice it:
?I felt that if people in America started reading our literature, eating our food, and listening to our music they would be less likely to want to bomb us and they'd be less likely to support our occupation.?

If you missed yesterday?s Grab, start here.
Today, we add a few speaking techniques to your arsenal. Many of us replay interactions in our minds after the fact, imagining all the things we could have said to stand up for ourselves. Practice these two simple phrases in your daily life and you?ll be more likely to be blunt on your feet next time.
Say ?No?
And do it without a qualifier. Don?t say ?no, but?? or ?not really? or ?maybe.? Simply say ?no.? It?s a powerful word when said alone and it may make you uncomfortable at first. The following everyday queries are great opportunities to use ?no.?:
Someone asking to take you out for a meal/coffee/drinks
Advances from a mall kiosk employee
Upsells from servers or retailers
Say ?Thank you?
Take credit for your worth. When someone compliments you, say ?thank you.? Don?t say ?thank you, but (so and so) helped? or ?oh, it wasn?t a big deal.? Don?t diminish your value by lessening your accomplishments. Own that brilliance.
Stop saying ?Sorry?
We aren?t asking you to remove this word from your vocabulary. If you truly did something wrong, by all means, let the ?sorry?s flow freely, but we want you to stop saying sorry for things that aren?t your fault. Don?t say it when you?re in a meeting and you need to insert your opinion. Here is a

"March  3, 2017","Your DGB for today is to call your Senators and Congressional representatives and ask them to demand the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
In his confirmation hearings, then-Senator Jeff Sessions had the following exchange with Senator Al Franken (D-MN):
Franken:
""CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that quote, ?Russian operatives claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.? These documents also allegedly say quote, ?There was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.?
""Now, again, I'm telling you this as it's coming out, so you know. But if it's true, it's obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?""
Sessions:
""Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have ? did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.""
He also addressed this in a written exchange with Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT):
Leahy:
""Several of the President-elect?s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?""
Sessions
: ""No.""
This was not true. Instead, Sessions, an early endorser and enthusiastic surrogate for Donald Trump, met with the Russian ambassador at least twice during the campaign.

March is Women?s History Month and DGB believes there is no use in celebrating women?s history if you aren?t going to be as intersectional as possible while doing it. First, you have to understand what intersectionality is. Yes, we understand some of you may already know and use it on the regular, but for those of you who don?t, intersectional feminism is feminism that advocates for the rights of all women. Intersectionality understands that not all women?s experiences are the same just because they are women, but identities like class, race, sexual preference, religion, and ethnicity, can all shape the way the world treats them and their outlooks. To learn more, read

How can you make sure your feminism is intersectional? Follow women that don?t look like you on your preferred social media sites, and for the love...please just listen.

"February 23, 2017","Your DGB for today is to learn how to get arrested. Let?s be clear: we don?t
want
you to get arrested, especially if you are non-white. We will not be covering tips on how to go to a demonstration where you
plan
to be arrested. What we want to do is tell you how to proceed
if
you find yourself in this situation.
We are all probably attending way more protests than we used to, especially if you?re using DGB?s
[list](https://www.dailygrabback.com/demonstrations/)
of upcoming protests, rallies and vigils.
Most demonstrations are peaceful and family-friendly, but that doesn?t necessarily mean things can?t go wrong. The usual reasons police give for arrests at protests are interfering with traffic, damaging public or private property, and blocking walkways, buildings, and doorways. A lot of this advice will not be new to People of Color, and is meant mostly for those new to the protest scene.
During the initial interaction:
If a law enforcement officer begins to confront you in a negative or threatening way, clearly state your compliance with their demands before acting: ?I understand you want me to place my bag on the ground. I?m going to place my bag on the ground, but I do not consent to a search.? or ?I am turning around and putting my hands up. I am not resisting.?
After arrest:
Once you are placed under arrest, do not speak again until you are at a precinct, and then, only ask to make a phone call. Calls will be very expensive, collect, and you will only get one, if you?re lucky. In the age of personal phones, you may be limited in whose phone number you have memorized. It?s also best to call a landline, if possible. This call will be recorded and should only convey where you are. You will be searched. It?s not optional, and will probably be humiliating. The police will take all your belongings from you.
Jail/Court/Charges:
Most people arrested at a protest are released without being charged, but it?s possible you will be brought to court and arraigned. Say nothing except ?not guilty.? It?s unlikely that you?ll be interrogated. You will probably sit in jail all day, though, and maybe overnight. If you get arrested on the weekend, it?s possible you?ll be there until Monday morning. Jail is almost always very cold and drafty. Keep this in mind when you dress for a protest.
The fact is, there?s a huge disparity between the way white people and non-white people are treated by law enforcement. This information is meant as a general guideline for everyone, but does not delve into the many facets of the relationship between police and People of Color. DGB does not intend to oversimplify or downplay the danger posed to non-white people in police interactions.",2017-06-07 01:51:22.328710,,"www.google.com/maps?q=40.7207559,-74.00076130000002",Getting Arrested,Parsed www.dailygrabback.comfor training data,,[],dailygrabback.com,"['DGB', 'Law Enforcement', 'Police', 'Arrests', 'Protest']",['Awareness'],https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/2/23/getting-arrested

[decline in large-scale donations from supermarkets](http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20161224/ri-food-bank-copes-with-declining-donations)
. With more sophisticated, computerized systems and efficiency strategies, grocers have gotten a lot better at eliminating waste, the unintended consequence of which was a sharp decline in the availability of surplus food to donate. Instead of relying on donations for the bulk of their inventory, many pantries and banks have had to resort to more wholesale purchasing. This means that your money, in the hands of food banks, will probably have more impact than if you spend it yourself on food to donate.

Recently, a group of high school seniors took their senior class photos. You may remember taking your own high school class photo, but what you (hopefully) don?t remember is having approximately 70 of your classmates give the

"February 20, 2017","Your DGB for today is to learn the four Ds of Bystander Intervention.
The only thing worse than being harassed because of your race, religion, sex, gender, orientation, or anything else, is being surrounded by strangers who choose to stand passively by. The four Ds are different methods you can use, individually or together, to support people who are being harassed while modeling intervention behavior for your community.
DGB has paraphrased the advice of
[Hollaback](https://www.ihollaback.org/)
, a great resource for advice and action on all types of harassment, including local Bystander Training classes.
Direct:
If you and the victim are both physically safe, and you are willing to assume the risk of the harasser redirecting their abuse toward you, choose a direct response. Tell the person doing the harassment to stop. Advise them to leave, if the situation allows. Take out your phone and start recording the incident if you can. Use our advice from
[this](https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/2/13/video-as-evidence)
past Grab while recording.
Distract:
De-escalate the situation by interrupting it. Ask the victim for directions or the time, placing yourself between the harasser and the victim while speaking. You can also cause a commotion by making a mess, such as spilling a drink.
Delegate:
Seek or enlist the help of a third party. Instruct another bystander to call the police or distract the harasser while you help the victim. Approach the bus driver or store manager and ask them to intervene.
Delay:
If you are unable to intervene during the altercation, you can still help by checking in with the victim once the incident has ended. Ask them what they need. Can you accompany them somewhere? Call someone for them? Help them make a report?
Remember, your intervention doesn?t have to be perfect. Any form of speaking up is better than nothing, and responding as a bystander also inspires others to courageously speak up in similar situations.",2017-06-07 01:51:29.198826,,"www.google.com/maps?q=40.7207559,-74.00076130000002",Bystander Intervention,Parsed www.dailygrabback.comfor training data,,[],dailygrabback.com,"['DGB', 'Bystander Intervention', 'hate crime', 'Hollaback', 'Harassment']",['Action'],https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/2/18/bystander-intervention

The order went into effect immediately, and chaos at our nation?s airports ensued. Teams of lawyers working pro-bono swooped in to help stranded and panicking travelers, and the outraged among us showed up en masse to protest.

The idea behind Norris?s Peabody Award winning project was to give people a platform to write a short ?essay? on race. That short essay is only six words, but six words can capture so much emotion. The project shows a wide range of thoughts and emotions tied to race, some funny, some heartbreaking, and some that will make you really angry. Michele Norris believes in being honest about race, which is why she puts them all up.

Remember those horrible first few days after Hillary lost and her supporters, particularly white progressive women, fumbled through life in a haze of tears and disbelief searching for a way to ?make it up? to the millions of minority Americans we let down? We took to social media in droves seeking a way to show how desperately sorry, ashamed, and ally-like we truly were. In an underwhelming act of ?support,? we dramatically pinned safety pins to our shirts to show the world we were a safe harbor in a sea of white supremacy and hate?or something like that. Shortly after many had pinned their blouses and some had started up Etsy shops selling safety pin earrings, necklaces and - yes - safety pins, the harsh, but deserved, criticism of this act?s tone deafness began. Minority activists criticized safety pins as another way white progressives pay lip service without actually mobilizing, speaking out, or attempting to dismantle institutionalized racism and discrimination.
Two Black women activists decided to turn this non-action into tangible action and developed Safety Pin Box; a subscription service that spells out true activism for the activist-adjacent. Actionable tasks are regularly assigned to subscribers and are meant to develop into collaborative local activism. From the website:
?Tasks will vary in scope from individual to group assignments, and task categories include data collection, personal development, influencing your networks, and showing radical compassion.?
So let us not ?put a pin in it,? but rather take up the mantle of true activism and embrace what it means to be a sincere accomplice in these uncertain times, and in doing so, support two Women of Color as they try to educate us.",2017-06-07 01:51:41.375692,,"www.google.com/maps?q=40.7207559,-74.00076130000002",Safety Pin Box,Parsed www.dailygrabback.comfor training data,,[],dailygrabback.com,"['DGB', 'Safety Pin Box', 'Safety Pin', 'Education', 'Backing Black Businesses']",['Activism'],https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/2/5/safety-pin-box

[Super Bowl](https://polarisproject.org/blog/2016/02/05/super-bowl-myth)

Last year alone there were over 26,000 calls to the Human Trafficking Hotline and 7,500 human trafficking cases
[reported](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/states)
.
While law enforcement agencies may see an uptick in sex trafficking during large events, the victims have typically been facing exploitation for a long time before the event occurs.
One way to help curb sex trafficking is to arrest the sex buyer, as opposed to the victim of sex trafficking.
[Statistics show](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/opinion/kristof-targeting-the-johns-in-sex-trade.html)
that a staggering 15% of men have bought sex, but those men have a 1 in 100,000 chance of getting arrested for it.
Increasing the punishment for purchasing sex should decrease the the amount of sex trafficking victims, because men will not want to suffer the legal and financial consequences. You can also contact your representatives and make sure they strengthen anti-human trafficking programs. Click

The year 2015 was dubbed the Year of the Period after a number of highly publicized events brought Aunt Flo into the

(who can forget a portrait of DJT painted in menstrual blood?) The result of openly discussing our monthly, also brought to light an issue that concerns half of Americans - namely the Tampon Tax. The name is a bit of a misnomer in that no, tampons aren?t specifically taxed, however, they aren?t exempt in most states as a basic necessity and are thereby subject to sales tax. Those critical of the tax (namely everyone who has to actually use these products), aptly point out that one may buy soda and candy at the grocery store free of tax, but not feminine hygiene products.
In 2016 legislators in 14 states and 3 major cities introduced bills to exempt feminine hygiene products from sales tax, however, most were vetoed or have stalled.
[Here](http://www.snopes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tampon-tax-state.jpg)

Only New York and Illinois, have taken steps to add their names to tax exempt states.
So, if the tax remains in 38 states, what can we do to protest the continued tax on this basic necessity? An article in Glamour

[article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/10/upshot/How-to-Prevent-Gun-Deaths-The-Views-of-Experts-and-the-Public.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FGun%20Control&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=7&pgtype=collection&_r=1)
showed that academics, experts, and citizens are in broad agreement on sensible measures to decrease gun violence.
More than 80% of Americans support universal background checks for gun buyers and mandatory reporting of lost or stolen guns, which experts agree would be effective in decreasing gun deaths.

There have been recent reports that church attendance is on an uptick since the election. A
[recent episode](http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2016-12-20/faith-leaders-on-efforts-to-unite-a-divided-country)
of the Diane Rehm Show on NPR highlighted this rise in attendance and had a Rabbi, a Muslim Chaplain, a Bishop, a Pastor, and a Theologian on as guests.
We are positive there is a joke about changing a lightbulb or walking into a bar in here somewhere, but they came on to speak about reaching out in their communities and neighborhoods to be more progressive and heal this country. The Pastor from Texas spoke about how, when he first moved to make his church more inclusive, he lost a lot of members, but what he lost, he quickly recovered plus some.
The desire for people to connect to a community is strong right now, especially with all the healing our country currently needs. Community and an urge to do something is why we started DGB; people want to come together for a purpose. This feeling of solidarity is what will get us through our darkest days as individuals and as a country. So, whether you choose to seek meaning in activism or through attending church, it?s important you research so you don?t inadvertently do harm.
If you are so inclined to join a church, or you are already attending one, we encourage you to make sure it is as inclusive as possible. Make sure it is a place where everyone has a home and can feel safe. This

"January 13, 2017","Your DGB for today is to contact Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS), who sits on the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works, and ask that he vote against Scott Pruitt to head the EPA.
Trump really captured his signature spirit of ironic cabinet picks with Pruitt?s nomination. As Oklahoma Attorney General, Pruitt is currently suing the agency he is tapped to lead. His LinkedIn profile calls him ?a leading advocate against the EPA?s activist agenda,? whatever that means. Unless Trump is playing Opposite Day, this nomination serves you that usual feeling about his Cabinet picks: a sprinkle of confusion, a big shot of alarm, and a puckering bite of anxiety.
Senator Moran is the only Majority member not to have met with Pruitt ahead of his hearings, with every other Republican on the committee praising the nominee.

This is probably going to come as a shock to you, but racism is alive and well in the publishing world and that means all of us lose. We might miss out on some of the greatest voices waiting to be heard and stories waiting to be told. Consciously combat falling into a rut of supporting mostly white authors by actively seeking out authors of color. By doing this, not only will we get to consume amazing art we may have overlooked, it can help us become better allies when we pursue non-white narratives.
DGB staff have picked a few of our favorites and are playing armchair literary-reviewers for a night. We imagine this involves cognac, a pipe, and thick-framed glasses. Or was that a 1800s detective? ?Whatever, here are our picks:

The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao
by Junot Diaz
The story overall is very heavy and sad, but the prose itself is so good and there is a very subtle humor so that it doesn?t necessarily *feel* that way as you move through it. It also did this interesting thing where you?re never quite sure if the narrator was reliable or if there was another explanation for the events that happened. Even a bit of a question mark as to whether the supernatural was involved.
Celestia -
Citizen: an American Lyric
by Claudia Rankine
An anthology of images, poems and essays had me sobbing within the first ten minutes. It's stories of racism and micro aggression in our so called post-racial society were eye opening, heart breaking, and thought provoking.
Emily -
The Business of Fancydancing
by Alexie Sherman.
It gives a real perspective about Native American life instead of some noble savage trope or the ?drunk Indian? for the other side of that racist coin.
MJ -
The Fifth Season
by N. K. Jemisin
This Fantasy novel has it all: compelling story, amazing world-building, a mold-breaking premise, and a bunch of badass women of color as main characters. I loved it and ever since I read it, I've been devouring everything else Jemisin has written.
Morgan -
A is for Activist
by Innosanto Nagara
A board book meant for the under three crowd that my five and eight year old still enjoy and holds even adult attention. Nagara also illustrated and man is it beautiful and diverse. Not your typical alphabet book: C is for co-op, F is for feminist, U is for unions, and Z is for zapatista, to name a few.
Nicole -
We Are the Ship: The Story of Negro League Baseball
by Kadir Nelson.
The book introduces racial discrimination, segregation, and intolerance in a child-appropriate way. Rich discussions can come out of reading about the athletes' struggles and triumphs, and the illustrations are amazing.
Rose -
Persepolis
by Marjane Satrapi
It's a graphic novel about the author's childhood in Iran during the revolution. I love it because it is beautiful, relatable, funny, and eye-opening. It's completely normal and completely shattering at the same time.
Suzie -
Kafka on the Shore
by Haruki Murakami
Described by the author as a series of riddles that function as the solution to those riddles, this book twists through magical realism (talking cats!), touching openness and raw personalities, and elements of Shintoism.

"January  5, 2017","Your DGB for today is to ask Obama to use his last days in office to pardon veterans who received dishonorable discharges from the military due to suicide attempts.
Warfare has left scores of veterans ill, injured, and traumatized. Unfortunately, after their service, these folks face a maze of bureaucracy and long waiting lists even when they are eligible for benefits from the Veteran?s Administration. Ineligibility for benefits puts someone in an even more dire situation, as the VA is often the ONLY access to health care a veteran has. What you probably didn?t know is that a suicide attempt while on active duty can mean a dishonorable discharge, subsequent denial of benefits, and a humiliating black mark on a resume. That?s right: we are punishing our own veterans for their emotional response to active duty.

Journalism is under attack and it?s more important now than ever that we support it, especially when that journalism comes from people of color. Women and people of color who work in journalism are far more likely to be targeted for online harassment than white men as

"December 26, 2016","Your DGB for today is to use our interactive links to increase your knowledge about HIV/AIDS and share with your circle.
Those who are living with the disease and who work on the front lines in HIV/AIDS public health and advocacy have voiced concerns over
[what a Trump Administration would look like for treatment, funding and research](http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=72130)
.
While Trump has not addressed HIV/AIDS directly, he has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, taking with it many initiatives HIV patients depend on. Those most at risk for contracting HIV already live in under-served and underprivileged areas, a threat which would only increase by restricting access to affordable treatment and care. HIV positive people are yet another group facing an uncertain future under the incoming administration.
Because there's great power in knowledge, we at DGB have provided three ways to increase your HIV literacy:

"December 22, 2016","Your DGB for today is to familiarize yourself with the most common ADA violations, the reporting process, and other ways to support the disabled community. Whether you have a disability or are looking to be a better ally, this will arm you with the tools you need to be an advocate.
Most of us will experience some kind of disability in our lifetime. This may be congenital, the result of a chronic illness or injury, or just part of the aging process. Despite how prevalent disabilities are, coupled with the fact that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is now almost 17 years old, many challenges exist for those with both visible and unnoticeable disabilities. These setbacks result in higher unemployment and higher poverty rates for the disabled community.
There is a wealth of specific ADA compliance information

Science is currently under attack in the US. Anti-science positions like climate change denial, creationism, anti-vaccination, and anti-stem cell research are commonplace among policy makers. These science deniers are in all levels of politics; starting local, like the board of education, and climbing all the way up Capitol Hill. We now have a President-elect who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, and who is tapping anti-science figures left and right for cabinet positions. Trump?s pick for head of the Department of the Interior, Rep. Ryan Zinke, doesn?t take climate change seriously. Neither does former Gov. TX Rick Perry, his pick for Secretary of Energy. The proposed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is a climate change denier. In short, Trump?s administration has the potential to be

First, find something in which to store your donations. Use whatever works best for you and your space, whether it be a basket, reusable shopping bags, or storage bins. (Yes, this is an excuse to go to Target.)
Next, familiarize yourself with the items that shelters need the most. Here's a list of the most-wanted items:
Socks and Shoes.
Pick up a pack of socks next time you are out shopping and go through your closet and donate those gently used shoes and boots that you just aren?t feeling anymore.
Blankets, Mats, and Sleeping Bags.
If it?s been years since you?ve been camping, and you know you likely are never going to venture into the woods again after that last tick encounter, please donate your sleeping bag. It truly can save a life.
Personal care items, specifically female hygiene products.
Periods are miserable enough when you are dealing with them from the comfort of your home. Add some pads and tampons to your donation box and make life a little easier for struggling women and girls.
Eye glasses.
Many homeless are in desperate need of reading glasses. You can grab cheap pairs of cheater glasses with various prescriptions from your local drugstore kiosk.
Linens and Towels.

Undocumented Migrants
[Pay Taxes](/s/undocumentedtaxes-1.pdf)
. Undocumented migrants pay 12 Billion dollars in taxes to social security ?alone, per year. Most of these people will never be able to collect their contributions to social security. ?They also pay sales taxes and property taxes, and many pay federal and state taxes.

Undocumented Migrants
[Do Not Drain Welfare Programs](http://newrepublic.com/article/122714/immigrants-dont-drain-welfare-they-fund-it)
.?Claims that migrants drain our welfare programs are false. By and large they do not qualify for them. The only exception is education. Only those who are legally documented migrants qualify for most of the benefits.
Undocumented Migrants
[Are Not Taking Our Jobs](http://theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/immigrants-arent-stealing-american-jobs/433158/)
.
Studies show that immigrants and natives compete for different jobs. Undocumented migrants often do jobs native born Americans do not typically do such as agricultural work, house cleaning, and food service. Native born Americans without high school diplomas tend to seek jobs as cashiers, truck drivers, and janitors.
Undocumented Migrants
[Do Not Bring Crime](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798)

Immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal activity than their native counterparts. Using a story of one undocumented migrant who engaged in criminal activity is a political ploy that obscures the facts: by and large undocumented migrants do not pose a threat to society.

"December 14, 2016","Monday, the ongoing situation in Aleppo reached its lowest point yet as civilians, including women and children, were shot or burned to death in their homes and in the streets and bombing reached critical mass.
The Syria Civil Defence (The White Helmets), Kesh Malek, Independent Doctors Association, and Syrian American Medical Society wrote:
?We are calling on the international community to provide a safe passage out of Aleppo for the remaining ~100,000 people. We know that the UN has a plan to get us out across the four kilometres of Western Aleppo to safety: with a few dozen buses and lorries we could all be evacuated in twenty four hours. However, we need the international community to guarantee the safety of their workers and our own.?
Tuesday, Turkey and Russia were finally able to facilitate a ceasefire deal to allow the remaining people in Aleppo to move to safety. Two dozen buses arrived to transport the displaced, as well as the hundreds of injured. Only needing to travel approximately three hours to the Turkish border, or less than an hour to Idlib, we remained hopeful that this was the beginning of the end to this nightmare. Evacuations were set to begin at 5am local time the following morning for a ride that, in a peaceful country, is merely a morning commute but in Aleppo means the difference between life and impending death.
It?s now Wednesday and the people of Aleppo still have no means of escape and nowhere to hide. Although evacuations were set to begin at dawn, residents were unable to leave before shelling began again at approximately 10am. The fragile ceasefire appears to have been broken by parties not included in ceasefire talks and who are now making their
[own demands.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/14/syrian-rebels-civilians-blocked-leaving-aleppo-pro-assad-militias/)
The buses returned to their depots empty today.
Now, there are victims currently dead and dying in the streets and no one to help heal the wounded. They are trapped by violence in a one-square-mile enclave of the city. These crucial evacuations require infrastructure to move people quickly and safely, the secure entry of humanitarian aid workers to help the sick and wounded, and UN observers to report human rights violations.
This is a quickly evolving situation and because of the current siege and how dangerous it is there for journalists, it is difficult to verify facts. DGB has identified one thing you can do immediately to put pressure on the international community to enforce safe passage for the last people of Aleppo.
Call the State Department at 202-647-9572 and the Russian Embassy at 202-298-5700 and say ?I am a concerned citizen of the world and I urge you to do anything and everything you can to facilitate the rescue of the remaining people in Aleppo.?
Do this now. Do this often. And please share widely.
Note: these numbers may be busy or have a full mailbox. This is a good thing, but we also encourage you to keep trying.

"December 13, 2016","Your DGB today is to train and prepare to defend yourself and others if the situation ever presents itself. The sad and scary truth is that with the ushering in of the President-Elect, a faction of people have been emboldened to carry out sexual or violent behavior against minorities and women. Today your DGB is to arm yourself with the tools, knowledge, and practice it takes to be prepared.
First, you need to research your best line of defense for your personal level of comfort. Most self-defense experts suggest that your best line of defense and protection is an item that is going to keep a great amount of distance between you and your attacker. Pepper spray is something that will keep space between you and the attacker and is relatively easy to use and can be used at a distance. All 50 states allow pepper spray, but check your local state
[law](http://bestpepperspray.net/pepper-spray-laws/)
.
to see if they have any restrictions. There are other options like
[key cats](http://collegekeycat.net/default.html)
for close-contact defense. They were developed not only for you to defend yourself, but also for you to gather DNA from attackers. An added bonus is that the company is run by women. Rape whistles are another option to alert others of an attacker.
The following is a list of tips to keep you safe. Share them with your friends and family and be sure to Grab Back.
Put your cell phone away! Walking around while looking at or talking on your cell phone makes you less aware of your surroundings and puts you at risk for an attack.
Avoid wearing headphones. Similar to having your eyes on your cell phone, if your ears are focused on something besides your immediate surroundings, you are less aware of any potential dangers, and an attacker will consider you an easier target.
Have your form of protection easily accessible at all times. For example, walk with your keys or pepper spray in your hands through a parking lot.
Park in well-lit areas and always be aware of your surroundings.
Take self-defense classes if possible.
[YWCA](http://www.ywca.org)
often offers free and local self-defense classes.
Watch videos on self-defense techniques and how to use your ?weapon? of choice. Make sure you are comfortable enough with it that it will feel like second nature if a time ever comes when you need to use it.
Here are a couple of easy self-defense moves to learn today and practice with friends -

"December  7, 2016","Your DGB for today is to contact Congress to express your support for a bill that will mandate
additional training for police officers in de-escalation and using the lowest level of force necessary.
In the last few years there have been a number of highly publicized and questionable police shootings against American citizens, especially those in marginalized communities. The Preventing Tragedies Between Police and Communities Act of 2016 is a bill currently before Congress that seeks to reduce these incidents through training. At DGB, we support this win-win effort to protect communities and support positive change.
The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee?s Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigation. We ask you to call your Senators and Representatives, and urge them to push the bill to a passing vote, ESPECIALLY if you are a constituent of committee members (looking at you, Wisconsin, Ohio, Virginia, Texas, Utah, South Carolina, Idaho, Colorado, and Michigan).

Currently, police spend 13 times more hours in training on gun use and mastering defensive tactics than they do in learning how to de-escalate conflicts. ?It?s time to change the way police departments approach officer training.

Your state?s absolute failure to act appropriately to prevent it can now only be mitigated by how it responds to the crisis. Begin the delivery of bottled water to residents without further appeal. The basic need of clean drinking water is not being met, and your administration is not only able to fix that, but was ordered to do so. Every day that you fight against that order, you are putting the health of your citizens at further peril. ?The nation is watching you.
Sincerely,

"November 30, 2016","Your DGB for today is to find out which clinics in your community offer free or discounted women?s health services and donate money or time to them. Often these clinics have specific needs, so it?s a good idea to check out their website or contact them to see what those are.
To find local women?s health clinics use
[Needy Meds,](http://www.needymeds.org/free_clinics.taf)
an online resource of free or sliding scale medical services.
Simply enter your zip code, and read the description of services offered to find low cost health care providers available to women in your area.
DGB is run by women, and access to health care (including reproductive rights) is a critical issue for us. The incoming Trump administration has been open about plans to cut funds to many women?s health clinics across the country. Changes to the ACA may also reduce access to birth control.

Many clinics that offer free or discounted reproductive health services have seen a spike in demand for birth control, especially IUDs.

These clinics need our support right now in order to continue to provide key services to women in their communities. After the election, we saw an awesome increase in donations to Planned Parenthood, but many other clinics have not seen equal support. We need to spread out our donations to all clinics in order to reach women throughout the country.

"November 29, 2016","Your DGB for today is to tell your senator to vote NO for Betsy DeVos? appointment to Secretary of Education. DeVos is totally unqualified for this position with no background in education, has never even attended a public school or sent her children to one.

"November 27, 2016","Your DGB for today is to support REAL journalism!
As citizens, it is our duty to be informed. But in the age of social media, we are consuming highly-filtered ?information? from a few sources. It?s time to stretch the quality and scope of information you consume and lend your support to authentic and thorough investigative journalism - the kind that doesn?t come packaged with a catchy meme about who got destroyed or had a mic drop. Today we ask you to read an old-fashioned print newspaper. Yes, a paper that you can actually hold in your hands.
Why is this an improvement over reading the stories you hear about on social media even if they come from reputable media sources? Because if you get all your news online, you likely only see the most discussed stories of the day. Trending topics obscure other important stories and local and foreign news is not be shared as much. We encourage you to tap into alternatives. Whether it be a local newspaper, an international newspaper, different websites, and, if you can afford it, a print newspaper subscription that will commit you to reading a variety of stories on a regular basis.
If you can?t afford a daily subscription, try the Sunday paper. Or, from time to time buy a paper from your local newsstand, and regularly browse the main pages of different types of online outlets.
Here are links to some of the most popular national and international papers. Don?t forget to look out for corporate, student, or other discounts that may apply to you, as well as Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.

"November 24, 2016","Your DGB for today is to help your community achieve year-round food security.
Like many people, you?ve probably participated in a holiday season food drive. It?s heartwarming and gratifying to see donations of food piling up in barrels in workplaces, markets and schools, and we encourage you to participate in these drives as you are able. But hunger is a year-round problem and often donations steeply decline when they are needed most, such as in late winter when the holiday season ends and in summer when children are out of school and are not able to participate in school lunch programs. Today we ask that you mark a date on your calendar in 90 days (or six months, or even quarterly) to donate to a food bank as donations begin to decline.
Happy Thanksgiving from DGB!
