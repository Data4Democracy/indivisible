It will be an opportunity to meet and connect with others in our community to discuss GMO's and to begin taking personal control of our food and exploring alternative options that are available to us. \n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nWHY DO WE MARCH?\n\nResearch studies have shown that Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s genetically-modified (GMO) foods can lead to serious health conditions such as the development of cancer tumors, infertility and birth defects. \n\n\nFor too long, Monsanto has been the benefactor of corporate subsidies and political favoritism. Organic and small farmers suffer losses while Monsanto continues to forge its monopoly over the world\xe2\x80\x99s food supply, including exclusive patenting rights over seeds and genetic makeup. Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s GMO seeds are harmful to the environment; for example, scientists have indicated that they have caused colony collapse among the world\xe2\x80\x99s bee population.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOLUTIONS ADVOCATED?\n\n- Vote with your wallet by buying organic and boycotting Monsanto-owned companies that use GMOs in their products. \n\n- Labeling of GMOs so that consumers can make those informed decisions easier. \n\n- Calling for further scientific research on the health effects of GMOs. \n\n- Holding Monsanto executives and Monsanto-supporting politicians accountable through direct communication, grassroots journalism, social media, etc. \n\n- Continuing to inform the public about Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. \n\n- Taking to the streets to show the world and Monsanto that we won\xe2\x80\x99t take these injustices quietly. \n\n\nWe will not stand for cronyism. We will not stand for poison. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we March Against Monsanto.\n\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION ON GMOs\n\nFor fantastic information and explanations on GMOs, including what products in Australia contain GMOs, please check out the following websites:\n\n\nYouTube documentary 'The World According to Monsanto':  https://youtu.be/87qrTXZaXkk\n\n\nhttp://www.madge.org.au/what-genetically-modified-gm-food\n\n\nhttp://www.march-against-monsanto.com/home/\n\n\nhttp://downtoearthmother.com/2013/06/19/how-to-avoid-gmo-foods-in-australia/\n\n\nhttp://safefoodfoundation.org/""",2017-05-18 22:57:10.673375,Sydney Town Hall ,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=-33.8731575,151.2061157",March Against Monsanto - Sydney,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Sydney Town Hall,['https://facebook.com/events/389192101434052'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-against-monsanto-sydney

"Jul 15, 2017  9:00 AM - Jul 15, 2017  2:00 PM EDT","b'MISSION\n\n\nMarch for Public Education: To promote public education through peaceful demonstration and action.\n\n\nVISION\n\n\nPublic Schools will be safe, inclusive spaces for learning and critical thinking, where all children discover their passion(s) and role(s) as citizens. As members of March for Public Education, we aim to advance policy and recursively address issues of: equity, inclusion, accountability, a well-funded institution and the right to organize.\n\n\nOUR PRINCIPLES\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must fight for equity. All students should enter the classroom on equal footing. Special educators, social workers, school psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, occupational therapists, and countless others are critical to creating an equitable school culture. Striving toward this ideal is the only way to create a meritocratic environment that is fair for all students.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must strive to create a safe space for all. In this regard, schools have the recursive responsibility to combat racism, sexism, ableism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public education empowers children to discover their desires, passions and potential. In turn, children become tenacious adults who are critical thinkers, involved citizens and lifelong learners. The arts, humanities, mathematics, sciences and physical education are equally vital in developing the whole child.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must be held accountable in the fight for equity. Accountability can include thoughtful standards and purposeful testing. These structures should strive to help schools provide a better education to students and should coincide with intentional professional development for teachers.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A well-funded public education is a right of all children, regardless of their intersectional identities. For profit educational institutions and their fundamental motivation for capital are incongruous in helping children realize their full identity.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Faculty and staff have the right and responsibility to organize. As members of the institution that is public education, stakeholders must challenge societal paradigms on behalf of students and the community.'",2017-05-18 22:59:17.057923,", Washington, DC","https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.9071923,-77.0368707",March For Public Education- Tentative Date,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Washington,['https://facebook.com/events/254445494966564'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-public-education-tentative-date

"Nov 7, 2017  6:30 AM - Nov 7, 2017  7:30 PM EST","b'""What can I do?""  \nSince the election, that\'s the question everyone\'s been asking - especially in North Carolina, where we\'ve recently seen seen rampant abuse of power by the GOP-dominated state legislature (see \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/us/politics/nort...\n)..\nThis event is a simple way to make a BIG difference. It exists solely to remind people that North Carolina is having a special election in 2017 for many legislative districts across the state.  \nWhy are we having a special election in 2017?  Because a federal court has ordered us to redraw many of our districts due to the unlawful use of race in the last round of redistricting (see \nhttp://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-governme...\n).  And new districts means new elections.\nHere\'s the big opportunity: If we can pick up a small handful of seats, we can break the GOP supermajority and sustain Gov. Cooper\'s vetoes.  Unlocking Gov. Cooper\'s veto would bring an abrupt halt to the far-right freight train that keeps pulling our state into the national news in ways that don\'t make us look good.\nThe key to winning those races is going to be getting out the vote, and this event is a simple tool to help do that.\nHere\'s all you need to do:\n1) Join our event.\n2) Share the event on your page (and re-share on your page whenever you think your friends need a reminder).\n3) ***Most Important*** - Invite your friends to join the event by clicking ""invite friends"" on the right-hand side of the event.  You can invite up to 500 friends.  Even if they don\'t join, they\'ll see the name of the event and that will tell them there\'s an election in 2017.\nThat\'s it!

"Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

Presentations will be provided by the following workshop partners:  ACLU, Casa Latina, OneAmerica, Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Southwest Youth and Family Services\nSummary of workshop:\nThe Trump Administration has taken multiple steps to target the immigrant and refugee members of our community, including: attempts to institute a Muslim Ban, denying federal funds to Sanctuary Cities, racist speech resulting in large increases in hate crimes, unjust deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to name a few.  Many in our Greater Seattle community want to take action to help local immigrants and refugees; this workshop is designed to provide specifics on how to help.  \nThis two-part workshop will: 1) provide a basic foundation for the current state of affairs for immigrants in the United States today, broken into four key areas, and 2) provide opportunities for community members and activists to learn about various organizations that are already mobilized to serve our immigrant neighbors within these four key areas (listed below).\nFour key pathways to help local immigrants and refugees:\nPath 1:  Current Legislative Framework \xe2\x80\x93 the ACLU will provide an update on Trump\'s attacks, including specifics as to how these proposed new laws and policies impact local immigrants, as well as ways we can fight back and advocate for policies reflecting a freedom/sanctuary community.\nPath 2:  Encountering Law Enforcement \xe2\x80\x93 it\'s likely not a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cif"" but \xe2\x80\x9cwhen"" Federal law enforcement will amplify their actions against local immigrants.  Casa Latina will discuss actions, strategies and tactics that are being developed to counter.\nPath 3:  Responding to Prejudice \xe2\x80\x93 Trump has unleashed much more free expression of prejudice, hatred and resentment through tactics of creating fear and encouraging blame against minorities.  New laws and policies are being crafted that are rooted in racism and prejudice.  OneAmerica will provide an overview of this dynamic and its impact on our communities.  In addition, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) will provide a talk on the rise of Islamophobia.  \nPath 4:  Meeting Basic Needs \xe2\x80\x93 Southwest Youth and Family Services will provide a talk on the most pressing needs for newly arrived immigrant families and their work around immigrant and refugee youth. \nAdditional immigrant/refugee support organizations invited to attend:\nAmericans for Refugees and Immigrants; East African Community Services; El Centro de la Raza; Jewish Family Service; Northwest Immigrant Rights Project; Northwest Justice Project; Horn of Africa Services (HOAS); Open Doors for Multicultural Families; Refugee Woman\'s Alliance; St. James Immigrant Assistance; Washington Community Action Network (CAN); White Center Community Development Association; World Relief Seattle\nPartnering organizations to date include:\nACLU\nAdmiral Congregational Church\nCasa Latina\nCommunities Rising!\nCouncil on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)\nHate Free Delridge\nInspireSeattle\nOneAmerica\nSouthwest Youth and Family Services\nWSUU'",2017-05-18 23:06:03.140324,"7141 California Ave SW, Seattle, WA, 98136","https://www.google.com/maps?q=47.5386818,-122.3876866",Workshop on Supporting Local Immigrants and Refugees,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Westside Unitarian Universalist Congregation Religious Exploration,['https://www.facebook.com/events/1354679381290793/?ti=icl'],risestronger.org,"['Immigration', 'Civil Rights and Civil Liberties', 'Healthcare']",['Other'],https://risestronger.org/events/workshop-on-supporting-local-immigrants-and-refugees

Please bring your favorite kids' books celebrating LGBTQIA+ folks of color, and at the end of the ride at Dennis The Menace Park we'll gather and share our families' favorites. All families welcome!\nKnowing our history helps build a brighter future for all children and books are an excellent tool to help families understand, appreciate, and facilitate dialogue.\nWe will meet in the parking lot across from the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey and head towards Dennis The Menace Park where we'll share the books our families have brought and watch our kids play! Don't have a bike? No worries! We'll do our best to keep the pace slow, so those on walking, rolling, and/or with strollers can keep up. If you want to just meet us at the park, that's also an excellent option. Hope to see you there!\nPlease note a helmet is required for all participants under 18 years of age. For recommendations and how to properly fit a helmet, please join the group: Family Biking Monterey County. We will have a couple pink/purple/orange Bell helmets (donated by the City of Monterey) that typically fit kids age 5-8 available to use during the ride. If you need one, please let us know ahead of time, so we can plan accordingly.\nThere are bathrooms at this location. However, there is no gender neutral availability. Please bring your own lunch. There is a picnic area. We recommend bringing your own blanket/chair as there are limited benches available around the playground area for seating. Also, bike parking is limited to just one rack (please bring a lock, if you need one) but we are working on having a local company provide valet service.\nFounded by Families of Color Monterey County (FoCMC) in October of 2016, Family Biking Monterey County is a grassroots effort dedicated to making bicycling accessible and affordable through advocacy, education, and community building.

As a community, we need to come together and stand up against the racially sparked discrimination and cruelty to our fellow community members. \nThose who are not being targeted need to stand up and fight for those that ARE being targeted. This event is to show solidarity in the fight for racial equality and justice.\nWe cannot accept police brutality, racial profiling, excessive incarceration for minor infractions, completely unjustified arrests, and shocking, indefensible deaths.

In a day and age where you won\'t risk being killed for doing so. So many faced unimaginable danger and even murder for standing up in 1965.

"Jul 2, 2017 12:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  3:00 PM MDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy.

"Jul 2, 2017 12:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  3:00 PM MDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.

This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

"Jun 2, 2017 10:00 AM - Jun 4, 2017  6:00 PM EDT","b'A powerful resistance is taking shape in the U.S. Mass spontaneous protests fill the streets and the opposition to the Trump regime heralds an era of civil unrest the likes of which America has not seen for decades. The protesters\' immediate object is the new president and the singularly dangerous and reactionary regime he leads, but it has the potential to move beyond Trump to address the system that produced him. Most important of all, the budding resistance is thinking through questions of power, strategy, and tactics. We find ourselves faced with unprecedented dangers and disorienting shocks but also with massive opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 openings for building the movements for justice and liberation and pressing for fundamental transformations.\nThe dangers are easy to name \xe2\x80\x93 the ascendance of the highly organized, racist, misogynist right to an office in the White House; Republicans in lockstep, ready to fulfill their dream of the final dismantling of the public sector and the welfare state; an authoritarian American president looking to find like-minded thug cronies across the globe to make deals to vacuum out the last iotas of resources and profit from a planet in deep crisis. Sadly, Trump\'s most institutionally powerful opponents are those who desire a return to the glory days of cold war with Russia, not to mention the military manufacturers, contractors, and press operations for whom war and conflict remains the most profitable racket. Other opponents are the Democrats, useless even when they haven\'t just totally ignored a populist moment to ensure the nomination of probably their least popular, most militaristic, and big-money friendly candidate over a popular socialist who could, no doubt, have beaten Trump at his own game.\nIt goes without saying that none of these institutional forces favors labor, communal ownership, race freedom, or ecological healing. As rival powers tear themselves apart fighting over the last remaining wealth of a broken system, we must find our leverage and build our power in this new, unstable situation.\nThese past few years have seen the rise of major protest movements, and America\'s decades-long slide to the right has been arrested. The population is polarized, but more radical on both sides than we\'ve seen in a very long time. On our side, direct action, especially among the brave fighters at Standing Rock, garners wide support. A democratic socialist got very close to the White House. Young Americans favor socialism over capitalism. The Black Lives Matter movement has forged an interracial coalition against police brutality and state sanctioned race murder. And millions of formerly docile centrists and liberals are being radicalized by the regime\'s newly bold expression of power and profit politics \xe2\x80\x93 without even the ideological patina of the \xe2\x80\x9cfree market"" or \xe2\x80\x9cdemocracy"" to paper over anti-worker and militaristic policies at home and abroad. Perhaps most important, people are talking general strike.\nIn short, the old \xe2\x80\x9creasonable, responsible"" regime of exploitation has broken down. These are radical times. Which means they are times with great possibilities for real radicalism. Still, the left forces are inchoate, without mass mobilization organizations and searching for strategies that can build raw power and generate victories. Our task is to help organize, nurture, and shape the raw resistance that is exploding across America \xe2\x80\x93 and help to build what may come in its wake.\nWhat lessons have we learned from the last year or so? What is the status of the strategy of working within the Democratic Party rather than forming a new party organized to represent the interests of the working class? Where is rank and file \xe2\x80\x93 and especially international \xe2\x80\x93 labor organizing today? Do the social identities that structure the everyday life of workers impede class organization \xe2\x80\x93 or do they point the way to the most militant varieties of it? Where can we find the leverage for our movements when great powers battle? How do we engage in the kind of robust international labor organizing that we know is both the key to workers\' power and the antidote to the anti-immigrant right ascendant in so many places today? Most important, how will we build the three structures that we know we need \xe2\x80\x93 radical cultural interventions that craft a lefty common sense; a political party for working class people, and, most important, the economic ability to bring production and reproduction to a halt through mass coordinated strike action.\nThis is where Left Forum 2017 comes in. The strength of LF has always been its ecumenical inclusion of many perspectives, many groups, fighting on many fronts. Together, we will craft a united front moving in diverse but coordinated ways toward what we all know we need \xe2\x80\x93 international, multiracial, non-gendered working class power. As the largest gathering of the U.S. left, we come together this year to debate, to plan, to strategize, to build. We will engage the key questions \xe2\x80\x93 historical, analytical, theoretical, strategic \xe2\x80\x93 and forge the path ahead together. Our work has never been more important.\nTo this end, Left Forum will be organized from the start around the key substantive issues in shaping the resistance. We are calling for all panels to submit to particular panel tracks. Each track will have a number of panels and should end either with a concrete organizing session or with a more informal social gathering where people can strategize, enjoy each other\'s company, and craft explicit next steps. This year, it is more important than ever that when we gather as a thousands-strong, non-sectarian left convergence, the conference helps us move as a broad front to the next crucial steps. We expect to have a record number of panel submissions and the truth is, there are only so many available rooms. Panel track organizing will be decentered but discriminating, so BRING YOUR A GAME. The moment demands nothing less from all of us.\nWe have no choice but to organize now to fight the reactionary assault on hard-won rights and freedoms, from unionization to civil rights to abortion. We must move from symbolic protest to materially effective resistance. We need to identify pressure points in the system and push them. We must think seriously about crafting a new political party in the United States. But we must also simultaneously be working toward the broader set of changes \xe2\x80\x93 from a system based on alienation, abstraction, and exploitation to one based on human freedom and possibility \xe2\x80\x93 that animates all our struggles and that unites us as a left.'",2017-05-18 23:06:32.227444,"524 W 59th St, New York, NY, 10019","https://www.google.com/maps?q=40.7707237,-73.9892342",Left Forum Conference 2017 - The Resistance,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,John Jay College of Criminal Justice,['https://facebook.com/events/1273563822706872'],risestronger.org,"['Energy and Climate', 'Governance and Rule of Law', 'Civil Rights and Civil Liberties', 'Economy and Jobs', 'Education', 'Healthcare']",['Conference'],https://risestronger.org/events/left-forum-conference-2017-the-resistance-59242597-6d42-486e-8986-a5845cf8b732

The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.\nThere is an active FBI investigation into these matters, and revelations may emerge any moment. But Congressional investigations in the House and Senate have been slow, under-resourced, and mired in partisan politics. Many Congressional leaders have called for an independent investigation, a special prosecutor or a commission to fairly investigate these concerns. Despite the clear will of the people, their calls have not been answered.\nTherefore, we call for a \n#MarchForTruth\n to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that American citizens want answers. The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.\nAcross the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd. Our goals are simple:\n\n\nCongressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests, or an independent investigation must be established,\n\n\nAs much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible,\n\n\nIf crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.\n\n\nOn June 3rd, Charleston SC will participate in a March for Truth ""Sister March"", to the D.C.

Ostracized as a ""red"" in the 1950s, she fought for an inclusive movement community and mentored three generations of social justice advocates.

Participants learn about the specific work undertaken in the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 boards, commissions, committees, councils and panels and working groups. Prior to convening the General Assembly, each participant will be assigned a country and guided through researching her country then writing a position paper.

"May 20, 2017  4:00 PM - May 20, 2017  7:00 PM CDT","b'The Affordable Care Act was a critically important step towards the goal of universal health care. Thanks to the ACA, more than 17 million Americans have gained health insurance. Millions of low-income Americans have coverage through expanded eligibility for Medicaid that now exists in 31 states. Young adults can stay on their parents\' health plans until they\'re 26. All Americans can benefit from increased protections against lifetime coverage limits and exclusion from coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Bernie was on the U.S. Senate committee that helped write the ACA.\nBut as we move forward, we must build upon the success of the ACA to achieve the goal of universal health care. Twenty-nine million Americans today still do not have health insurance and millions more are underinsured and cannot afford the high copayments and deductibles charged by private health insurance companies that put profits before people.\nThe U.S. spends more on health care per person, and as a percentage of gross domestic product, than any other advanced nation in the world, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. But all that money has not made Americans healthier than the rest of the world. Quite simply, in our high-priced health care system that leaves millions overlooked, we spend more yet end up with less.\nOther industrialized nations are making the morally principled and financially responsible decision to provide universal health care to all of their people\xe2\x80\x94and they do so while saving money by keeping people healthier. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short.\nAmericans need a health care system that works for patients and providers. We need to focus our federal investments on training the health care providers. We need to ensure a strong health care workforce in all communities now and in the future. We need to build on the strength of the 50 years of success of the Medicare program. We need a health care system that significantly reduces overhead, administrative costs and complexity. We need a system where all people can get the care they need to maintain and improve their health when they need it regardless of income, age or socioeconomic status. We need a system that works not just for millionaires and billionaires, but for all of us.\nUnder Bernie\'s plan, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment. That freedom would not only help the American people live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives, but it would also promote innovation and entrepreneurship in every sector of the economy. People would be able to start new businesses, stay home with their children or leave jobs they don\'t like knowing that they would still have health care coverage for themselves and their families. Employers could be free to focus on running their business rather than spending countless hours figuring out how to provide health insurance to their employees. Working Americans wouldn\'t have to choose between bargaining for higher wages or better health insurance. Parents wouldn\'t have to worry about how to provide health insurance to their children. Americans would no longer have to fear losing their health insurance if they lose their job, change employment or go part-time. Seniors and people with serious or chronic illnesses could afford the medications necessary to keep them healthy without worry of financial ruin. Millions of people will no longer have to choose between health care and other necessities like food, heat and shelter, and will have access to services that may have been out of reach, like dental care or long-term care.\nSimply put, Bernie\'s plan will provide all Americans with the sense of freedom and peace of mind that comes from knowing you always have access to the health care you need.\nTHE PLAN\nBETTER COVERAGE\nBernie\'s plan would create a federally administered single-payer health care program. Universal single-payer health care means comprehensive coverage for all Americans. Bernie\'s plan will cover the entire continuum of health care, from inpatient to outpatient care; preventive to emergency care; primary care to specialty care, including long-term and palliative care; vision, hearing and oral health care; mental health and substance abuse services; as well as prescription medications, medical equipment, supplies, diagnostics and treatments. Patients will be able to choose a health care provider without worrying about whether that provider is in-network and will be able to get the care they need without having to read any fine print or trying to figure out how they can afford the out-of-pocket costs.\nWHAT IT MEANS FOR PATIENTS\nAs a patient, all you need to do is go to the doctor and show your insurance card. Bernie\'s plan means no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges.\nGETTING HEALTH CARE SPENDING UNDER CONTROL\nWe outspend all other countries on the planet and our medical spending continues to grow faster than the rate of inflation. Creating a single, public insurance system will go a long way towards getting health care spending under control. The United States has thousands of different health insurance plans, all of which set different reimbursement rates across different networks for providers and procedures resulting in high administrative costs. Two patients with the same condition may get very different care depending on where they live, the health insurance they have and what their insurance covers. A patient may pay different amounts for the same prescription depending solely on where the prescription is filled. Health care providers and patients must navigate this complex and bewildering system wasting precious time and resources.\nBy moving to an integrated system, the government will finally have the ability to stand up to drug companies and negotiate fair prices for the American people collectively. It will also ensure the federal government can track access to various providers and make smart investments to avoid provider shortages and ensure communities can access the providers they need.\nMAJOR SAVINGS FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES\nBernie\'s plan will cost over $6 trillion less than the current health care system over the next ten years.\nThe United States currently spends $3 trillion on health care each year\xe2\x80\x94nearly $10,000 per person. Reforming our health care system, simplifying our payment structure and incentivizing new ways to make sure patients are actually getting better health care will generate massive savings. This plan has been estimated to save the American people and businesses over $6 trillion over the next decade.\nThe typical middle class family would save over $5,000 under this plan.\nLast year, the average working family paid $4,955 in premiums and $1,318 in deductibles to private health insurance companies. Under this plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the single-payer program, amounting to a savings of over $5,800 for that family each year.\nBusinesses would save over $9,400 a year in health care costs for the average employee.\nThe average annual cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes $50,000 a year would go from $12,591 to just $3,100.\nHOW MUCH WILL IT COST AND HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT?\nHOW MUCH WILL IT COST?\nThis plan has been estimated to cost $1.38 trillion per year.\nTHE PLAN WOULD BE FULLY PAID FOR BY:\nA 6.2 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers.\nRevenue raised: $630 billion per year.\nA 2.2 percent income-based premium paid by households.\nRevenue raised: $210 billion per year.This year, a family of four taking the standard deduction can have income up to $28,800 and not pay this tax under this plan.A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.\nProgressive income tax rates.\nRevenue raised: $110 billion a year.Under this plan the marginal income tax rate would be:\n37 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000.\n43 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million.\n48 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million. (In 2013, only 113,000 households, the top 0.08 percent of taxpayers, had income between $2 million and $10 million.)\n52 percent on income above $10 million. (In 2013, only 13,000 households, just 0.01 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10 million.)\nTaxing capital gains and dividends the same as income from work.\nRevenue raised: $92 billion per year.Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest American in the country, has said that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. The reason is that he receives most of his income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a much lower rate than income from work. This plan will end the special tax break for capital gains and dividends on household income above $250,000.\nLimit tax deductions for rich.\nRevenue raised: $15 billion per year. Under Bernie\'s plan, households making over $250,000 would no longer be able to save more than 28 cents in taxes from every dollar in tax deductions. This limit would replace more complicated and less effective limits on tax breaks for the rich including the AMT, the personal exemption phase-out and the limit on itemized deductions.\nThe Responsible Estate Tax.\nRevenue raised: $21 billion per year.This provision would tax the estates of the wealthiest 0.3 percent (three-tenths of 1 percent) of Americans who inherit over $3.5 million at progressive rates and close loopholes in the estate tax.\nSavings from health tax expenditures.\nRevenue raised: $310 billion per year. Several tax breaks that subsidize health care (health-related \xe2\x80\x9ctax expenditures"") would become obsolete and disappear under a single-payer health care system, saving $310 billion per year.Most importantly, health care provided by employers is compensation that is not subject to payroll taxes or income taxes under current law. This is a significant tax break that would effectively disappear under this plan because all Americans would receive health care through the new single-payer program instead of employer-based health care.\nCome join us and five other cities across Iowa who will be holding Medicare For All Rallies on May 20th.

The co-chairs will be responsible for guiding the ongoing development of the march, which will take place on June 11 in Washington, DC. \n""This is the most diverse national executive committee of any of the past five LGBTQ+ marches in Washington"" said San Diego City Commissioner and National Co-Chair Nicole Murray Ramirez, who has served on the national organizing committees of all five past Marches in Washington. ""From queer youth, Two-Spirit members, Transgender, Black Lives Matter activists, Undocumented, Immigrant, to HRC, AmFar, and various organizations. The Equality March and the rally stage will indeed truly represent the changing faces of the U.S. and of our LGBTQ+ movement.""\nInspired by the queer liberation movement\'s history of diverse, inclusive, and politically resonant public demonstrations, the Equality March for Unity and Pride will elevate and mobilize LGBTQ+ communities by highlighting those who, historically, have been actively silenced and neglected in the fight for full liberation, so that we may find unity and strength through diversity. The march is centered on the principle that in order to heal from the decades of neglect and erasure of marginalized people in the community, we must center transgender and gender expansive communities, and people of color. The co-chairs demand the inclusion of those left behind by social justice movements, including Black, Latinx, Bisexual, and differently-abled individuals. The co-chairs firmly believe that the community finds strength in diversity, and that the current political and social movement demands not just solidarity, but work towards intentional equity, representation, and protection of the most vulnerable. \nEquality March planners are working in coordination with the National Parks Service. Further details on the logistics of the march will be released in the coming weeks. \nSister marches are planned in more than 25 cities across the country for June 11 in solidarity with the March\'s mission to support the ongoing struggle for rights and safety for all LGBTQ+ individuals and families with similar emphasis on queer people of color,transgender, and gender nonconforming communities.\n""As a cis gay white male of privilege, I recognize that for far too long certain members of LGBTQ+ Communities have been underserved both here in the United States and abroad,"" said national co-chair David Bruinooge. ""They need to finally be given the same equity, equality, visibility, protection, access, liberties, justice, and inclusion as the most privileged among us in the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ liberation. This movement is an opportunity for LGBTQ+ communities to move forward together in solidarity and ensure together that all all our voices will not be silenced by those who want to roll back previous progress or impede necessary future change.""\n""Transgender people are at the front lines of every movement from immigration and reproductive justice to the fight for Black Lives Matter yet our realities and experiences need to be centered and our voices amplified,"" said Catalina Velasquez, Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships and Communications at Casa Ruby,President of Consult Catalina, and Board Vice-Chair of Our Revolution. She is the first undocumented transgender woman appointed Commissioner of the DC Mayor\'s Office of Latino Affairs, and a national co-chair of the March. ""Sexual and Gender liberation are key in our resistance to the current anti-immigrant and anti-transgender administration and the ongoing slaughter of transgender people of color. I am part of this march so the T in LGBTQ+ is not a footnote or a lost addendum in an everyday larger acronym. I march because there are 11.2 million undocumented immigrants of which hundreds of thousands are LGBTQ+ facing persecution, detention, and deportation to a death sentence, yet we see little to no public outcry. I march because pride is an act of resistance in a world where over 80 countries criminalize people based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity.""\nOur national Co-Chairs include: \n1.\nAnika Simpson, Ph.D.\n, Founder, Beyond Policy LLC | Associate Professor of Women\'s & Gender Studies and Philosophy at Morgan State University | Pronouns: She, Her, Hers\n2.\nAshley Smith\n, The Capital Pride Alliance | Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Board Member | Pronouns: He, Him, His\n3.\nCatalina Velasquez\n, Consult Catalina President | Casa Ruby Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships and Communications | Washington DC Mayor\'s Office of Latino Affairs Commissioner | Our Revolution Board Vice Chair | GetEqual Board Co-Chair | Megaphone Strategies Board Member | Inclusv Board Member | Trans United Fund Board Member | United We DREAM\'s Queer Undocumented Immigrant Project (QUIP) Advisory Council | Pronouns: She, Her, Hers, Trans Goddess.\n4.\nDavid Bruinooge\n, Founder: The Equality March for Unity & Pride | Pronouns: He, Him, His\n5.\nElle Hearns\n, Executive Director of The Marsha P Johnson Institute | Pronouns: She, Her, Hers\n6.\nJos\xc3\xa9 L.

Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

However while chemical agriculture pushes us towards climate crisis - small-scale, agro-ecologic farmers are standing up to remind us that healthy soil, diverse seeds and strong farming communities are in fact an essential solution to cool the planet and feed the world in a just and sustainable manner. As La Via Campesina points out, \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies for sustainable agriculture on a small-scale can not only reduce emissions from industrial agriculture, but can in fact contribute to carbon sequestration in the soil, and through the preservation of native forests and biodiversity.""\nIn countries around the world, women, who produce 60-80% of all food in developing nations, are rising to protect their soil, seeds, lands and livelihoods. In this training we will explore women leading movements for healthy soils and regenerative farming and the role of soils in climate solutions, while also understanding that farming land cannot become a carbon offset mechanism for managing the climate crisis. Presenters will discuss women farmers, agro-ecology, peasant farming, and carbon sequestration as part of the solution to the climate crisis, while highlighting farmers\' rights, food sovereignty and ecosystem integrity.\nSpeakers to date include: Precious Phiri (Regeneration Internationall, Zimbabwe); Diana Donlon (Center for Food Safety\'s Cool Foods Campaign, USA); Elizabeth Mpofu (General Coordinator of La Via Campesina, Zimbabwe); Calla Rose Ostrander (Project Drawdown, USA)\nFull details, speaker biographies and call in information will be available at: \nhttp://wecaninternational.org/pages/us-climate-ini...'",2017-05-18 23:13:03.146793,,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=34.1047122,-117.5788718","Women for Soils: Healthy Soils, Restorative Small-Scale Farming",Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,"FREE, ONLINE TRAINING",['https://facebook.com/events/373858063007189'],risestronger.org,[],['Public Talk'],https://risestronger.org/events/women-for-soils-healthy-soils-restorative-small-scale-farming

We call on the people of the United States to rise up in solidarity with those who stand to lose the most under the Trump administration & take to the streets to #MarchAgainstTrump in order to call for his Impeachment from the Presidency of the United States of America.

CCA was quoted in their 2014 Annual Report: ""The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.""

It should take us about 15 minutes to walk to Market Square where we will hold a visibility until 3 PM.\n\n\nWhy do we march?\n\n\nResearch studies have shown that Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s genetically-modified foods can lead to serious health conditions such as the development of cancer tumors, infertility and birth defects. In the United States, the FDA, the agency tasked with ensuring food safety for the population, is steered by ex-Monsanto executives, and we feel that\xe2\x80\x99s a questionable conflict of interests and explains the lack of government-lead research on the long-term effects of GMO products. Recently, the U.S. Congress and president collectively passed the nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cMonsanto Protection Act\xe2\x80\x9d that, among other things, bans courts from halting the sale of Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s genetically-modified seeds.\n\n\nFor too long, Monsanto has been the benefactor of corporate subsidies and political favoritism. Organic and small farmers suffer losses while Monsanto continues to forge its monopoly over the world\xe2\x80\x99s food supply, including exclusive patenting rights over seeds and genetic makeup. Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s GMO seeds are harmful to the environment; for example, scientists have indicated they have caused colony collapse among the world\xe2\x80\x99s bee population.\n\n\nWhat are solutions we advocate for?\n\n\nVote with your dollar by buying organic and boycotting Monsanto owned companies that use GMOs in their products. Labeling of GMOs so that consumers can make those informed decisions easier. Repealing relevant provisions of the US\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMonsanto Protection Act.\xe2\x80\x9d Calling for further scientific research on the health effects of GMOs. Holding Monsanto executives and Monsanto-supporting politicians accountable through direct communication, grassroots journalism, social media, etc. Continuing to inform the public about Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. Taking to the streets to show the world and Monsanto that we won\xe2\x80\x99t take these injustices quietly. We will not stand for cronyism. We will not stand for poison.

Mental health is suffering for many people under the relentless assaults on our democracy and the daily insanity from our government. It's hard to fill your cup of hope sometimes, and that is what this event is designed to do. There is strength in knowing that you are not alone. Music can fill us in ways that sustain us when it's hard to keep fighting for what we believe in. Everyone needs to see light in the darkness. Let's be that light for one night. \n\n\nWhat to bring: \n\nMason or similar glass jar\n\nSmall candle or LED electric candle\n\nAs many people as you can to participate!\n\n* Optional: Sign with the name of your organization and contact info\n\n* Optional: your camera or cell phone\n\n\nThank so much for helping make this night of peaceful resistance happen! Here's the plan:\n\n\nWe are going to use light and sound to bring hope to anyone feeling the progressive blues. To do this, you will need to carry a jar and your candle in a purse or pocket. Part of the fun of a Flash Mob is the surprise, so we want to make sure that your candle and jar are hidden until the time is right. The same goes with any posters you are bringing. \n\n\nHave fun at First Friday! You don't need to arrive at 6, just make sure you are somewhere mingled in the crowd by 8. Set a vibration timer on your phone to alert you at dusk, which is 8:32 pm. When your alarm goes off, light your candle (or turn it on) in your mason jar and walk quietly towards the street directly in front of the Hamburger in, facing towards Old Bag of Nails. A soloist will be singing to bring everyone to the correct spot. The people not in Vocal Resistance will form a ring around the choir holding their candles, as Vocal Resistance performs. If you have a sign, now is the time to get it out! We will stand silently around the choir until the songs are finished, then clap or cheer. Then we disperse back out into the crowd, and that's it! You have demonstrated that there are progressive voices in our community, and they are beautiful. The Resistance can be powerful, peaceful, and inspiring. \n\n::::\n\nHere is the official info from First Friday's event ont May 5.

Registration begins at 6 p.m., with the walk starting at 7 p.m. at the intersection of West Winter and North Sandusky streets.\n\n\nThe event is intended to open up discussion about sexual violence and to highlight agencies in place to help victims.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to let victims know they\xe2\x80\x99re not alone, that help is available,\xe2\x80\x9d said Trish Wright, victim services director for the Delaware County Prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s Office. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the community taking a stand together to stop the violence, and literally, walk a mile in her shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nTo support the crowd of walkers and other guests, additional free First Friday parking will be available at both the Delaware Police Department, 70 N.

Colorado farmers grow well-known crops like Rocky Ford Cantaloupe and Pueblo Chile, but the urban farming scene in Colorado is growing also!

"Jun 3, 2017 10:00 AM - Jun 3, 2017  1:00 PM PDT","b""There is more than sufficient cause for alarm about the role Russian state-led hacking and information warfare played in the 2016 election, and there are crucial unanswered questions about the relationship between the Russian state and Donald Trump, his associates and his campaign. The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.\nThe President just fired the FBI Director, a highly concerning move that may be intended to thwart the ongoing FBI investigation into Russian interference and ties to Donald Trump and his associates. Congressional investigations in the House and Senate have been slow, under-resourced, and mired in partisan politics. Many Congressional leaders have called for an independent investigation, a special prosecutor or a commission to fairly investigate these concerns. Despite the clear will of the people, their calls have not been answered.\nTherefore, we call for a #MarchForTruth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that the people want answers.\nThe legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.\nAcross the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd.\nOur goals are simple:\n1.) A special prosecutor must be named, an independent commission established and Congressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests.\n2.) As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible.\n3.) Congress should require Donald Trump to release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity.\n4.) If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.\n________________\nFor more information, press inquiries, or to volunteer: \n[email\xc2\xa0protected]\n/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\nFor general information on the national marches: \n[email\xc2\xa0protected]\n/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\n*More event details will be released as soon as possible.""",2017-05-18 23:16:39.826598,"Seattle, WA","https://www.google.com/maps?q=47.6062095,-122.3320708",March For Truth Seattle,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,,['https://facebook.com/events/1723249677690442'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-truth-seattle

At the time the U.S. was founded, its female citizens did not share all of the same rights as men, including the right to vote. It was not until 1848 that the movement for women's rights launched on a national level with a convention in Seneca Falls, New York, organized by abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) and Lucretia Mott (1793-1880). Following the convention, the demand for the vote became a centerpiece of the women's rights movement. Stanton and Mott, along with Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) and other activists, formed organizations that raised public awareness and lobbied the government to grant voting rights to women. After a 70-year battle, these groups finally emerged victorious with the passage of the 19th Amendment.\nNOTE : If you are one of over 3,000 officially registered Indivisible Groups via \nindivisibleguide.com\n and are interested in organizing to host and promote the Indivisible Suffragette Sisters 19th Amendment Anniversary March as an Event in your area please contact the Board of Directors and message for more information on the ISS Facebook Page.\nLINK : \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/SUFFRAGETTESISTERSANDBROTHERS/about/?ref=page_internal\n \nFurther Description : TBA""",2017-05-18 23:17:43.157065,,,19th Amendment 100th Anniversary March,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,['https://facebook.com/events/206869993130547'],risestronger.org,['Civil Rights and Civil Liberties'],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/19th-amendment-100th-anniversary-march

Patriotic attire to display our love of this country.  Speakers and march route still in the works.\nHere's why we're doing this:\nThere is more than sufficient cause for alarm about the role Russian state-led hacking and information warfare played in the 2016 election, and there are crucial unanswered questions about the relationship between the Russian state and Donald Trump, his associates and his campaign. The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted.\nThere is an active FBI investigation into these matters, and revelations may emerge any moment. But Congressional investigations in the House and Senate have been slow, under-resourced, and mired in partisan politics. Many Congressional leaders have called for an independent investigation, a special prosecutor or a commission to fairly investigate these concerns. Despite the clear will of the people, their calls have not been answered.\nTherefore, we call for a #MarchForTruth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that Americans want answers. The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.\nAcross the country, peaceful demonstrations will be arranged on Saturday, June 3rd. Our goals are simple:\n1. A special prosecutor must be named and Congressional investigations must be fully resourced.;\n2. As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;\n3. Donald Trump should release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;\n4. If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.\nJoin us!""",2017-05-18 23:19:31.616631,"400 S Orange Ave, Orlando, FL 32801-3336","https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.5376214,-81.3796806",March For Truth,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Orlando City Hall,['https://facebook.com/events/1692237401084759'],risestronger.org,['Governance and Rule of Law'],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-truth-6b8204ab-89fd-4ece-b546-8dd8cc9bc2be

"Jul 2, 2017  2:00 PM - Jul 2, 2017  5:00 PM EDT","b'WHY WE MARCH\n\nNO MORE PROPAGANDA - A CALL FOR THE MARCH FOR REAL NEWS\n\n\nIn 1985 the United States had over 50 media companies.  Today just six, corporate-owned conglomerates control mainstream media. This means that only 232 media executives hold sway over the information diet of 277 million Americans - that is, 90% of what we read, watch, or listen to.*\n\n\nWhen thus allowed to dominate, corporations inevitably manipulate media to suit their own interests.  When media networks are owned, funded, and controlled by a web of corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, information that does not fit their agenda can be easily filtered out or manipulated.  \n\n\nWe have recently seen many important events  ignored  by the mainstream media for this very reason.  These deliberate, glaring omissions have been notably criticized by public voices such as Robert McChesney, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, and most recently, Senator Bernie Sanders who stated, ""Corporate media threatens our democracy.  This is a crisis we can no longer afford to ignore.""\n\n\nA biased, mainstream media is a major cause for the decline of our democracy today. Voices are silenced and critical thinking opportunities are missed when corporations can push out only those news stories that won\xe2\x80\x99t hinder profits.    \n\n\nOn July 2, 2017,  we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.  This March is a call to critically examine the media\'s role in our democracy, a call to demand FACTS  rather than fake, corporate-purchased news, and a call for the renewed integrity from the journalistic community that will put the power of information back into the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Through a coalition of independent journalists, devoted to journalistic integrity, we can transform the global media landscape and make the news industry accountable again.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017 stand with us and march on Washington D.C. and all around the world to demand Real News while we defend Freedom of Speech.\n\n\n*Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6\n\n\nWHEN WE MARCH\n\nJuly 2, 1864 was the birth date of the iconic Father of Journalism Walter Williams who founded the world\'s first journalism school at the University of Missouri, and later he also created the Journalist creed in 1914. This Journalist creed is a statement of professional guidelines often evoked as the definitive code of ethics for journalists. It is posted in bronze at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThis creed was to be followed by millions of journalists who aspire to bring truth to the world and act as defenders of democracy. March For Real News has chosen this date as a celebration of Walter William\'s life achievements and raise awareness of the role media plays in democracy and the importance of the Journalist creed he created.\n\n\nOn July 2, 2017, we welcome you to join in a landmark event, called The March for Real News, which will take place in Washington DC as well as additional locations nationwide and around the globe.

On Guantanamo, he said he wants to keep the prison open and ""load it up with some bad dudes"".  Now, more than ever, is the time for us to stand against these crimes against humanity. President Obama broke his promise - 41 men remain imprisoned at Guantanamo. A powerful movement against torture and illegal detention is their best chance for justice.\n\n\nFifteen years ago, the United States brought the first detainees to Guantanamo Bay. The detention center has since then become a place of torture and shame. Released detainees claimed that waterboarding, sexual humiliation, and forced drugging were used on prisoners. Six detainees have committed suicide. \n\n\nSince January 11 2001, 779 men have been sent to Guantanamo Bay without trial and have been jailed without ever having been charged with any crime. As of March 2017, 41 prisoners remain locked up. A horrific torture prison created under George Bush remains up and running under President Trump, despite Barack Obama\'s infinite promises to the American people that he would shut it down. \n\n\nWikileaks produced documents from the US government stating that at least 150 Afghanis and Pakistanis detained in Guantanamo were never a risk at all, were brought in by mistake or for no clear reason, and then were held without due process for years. These innocent people include a camera man from Al Jazeera and a 70 year old with dementia with ""no reason on record"" for being held. They have been separated from their families and subjected to cruel treatment for absolutely no reason. \n\n\nWE SAY NO MORE!\n\n\nJoin us in Miami on this terrible anniversary as we march to the headquarters of Southern Command, the center that operates Guantanamo Bay military base and detention center, and demand that fifteen years of torture and shame come to an end!'",2017-05-18 23:21:06.217960,"9301 NW 33rd St, Doral, FL, 33172","https://www.google.com/maps?q=25.8049792,-80.3503638",Shut Down Trump's Torture Prison at Guantanamo!,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM),['https://facebook.com/events/394487687583928'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/shut-down-trump-s-torture-prison-at-guantanamo

His immediate executive orders have targeted Muslims, immigrants, women, Trans youth, and Black people severely. His appointments and early policies also reveal a total disdain for any of the hard fought gains won by people\'s movements from the last century, including environmental protections, Civil Rights, unions, public education, and social services. His belligerence has extended across the world with war threats on multiple countries, a grossly expanded military budget, and resumption of a nuclear arms race. \nBut the attacks on oppressed people at home are not limited to those carried out by racist ICE and cops. Since Trump\'s inauguration more than 90 bomb threats have been made on Jewish centers, dozens of mosques have been burned, over 400 reported hate crimes have taken place, including murders carried out by white supremacists. When confronted, the government\'s reply to this surge in racist violence has been little more than a shoulder shrug. \nThe Democrats have postured as though they are resisting this assault on people\'s rights but their record already tells a different story of continued bootlicking of Wall Street and the military. Nothing is more telling of this fact than their decision to maintain the status quo leadership by electing Tom Perez as DNC and refusing to ban corporate lobbying. The only ""resistance"" the Democrats have mounted is one based on the desire of the Pentagon and CIA to launch an all out war on Russia despite the fact it is the people of the U.S. and the people of Russia who will suffer while they and their children sit comfortably on Capitol Hill raking in money. \nA glimmer of hope has risen up though with innumerable protests taking place all over the country from the mass actions in defense of Native rights to marches for healthcare and political strikes by immigrants and women. It was the people who defeated the first Muslim ban when they boldly took over airports. Only this militant, independent action can stand up to Trump, the duopoly, and Wall Street. \nAnd while Wall Street and the pentagon have their representatives in the Democrats and Republicans, we too, the people, need our own leaders. Only a true people\'s party that fights for the people\'s rights can build and lead a resistance movement capable of defeating Trump and his worse policies. Only a true people\'s party can finally break the dictatorship that the billionaires and bankers hold over society and build a new world. \nJoin the Party for Socialism and Liberation for our Los Angeles Socialism Conference titled, ""Building  a People\'s Party"". We will have a  series of workshops and panels to discuss burning questions facing the people and movement in the era of Trump.

We're rallying because the oil industry has captured our democracy, and we're going to take it back!  \n\n\nMARCH AND RALLY INFORMATION:\n\n\nWHEN: Saturday May 20\n\nTIME: 12 Noon to 3pm\n\nWHERE: The Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion\n\nLOCATION: 16TH St. and H St., Sacramento\n\n\nURL coming soon:  www.OilMoneyOut.org \n\n\nHere's why we're rallying: \n\n\nIn the past year, the oil industry spent an historic 36.1 million dollars to lobby California lawmakers. Over the past 6 years, the industry has spent 122 million, more than any other interest group. This spending spree has paid huge dividends for these companies, allowing them to quash or neuter any meaningful legislation that might significantly curb their power to drill and pollute. This is particularly significant as during this time, the state of California performed independent studies which had notable findings on the toxicity of oil operations and made strong recommendations to protect public health, none of which have been implemented or addressed, leaving the general public vulnerable to contamination and toxic exposure.\n\n\nAs guardians of the public trust, the lack of action from our governor and our legislators our to protect the public is unacceptable.   \n\n\nThis past year, several environmental groups tried to push forward bills in the legislature to stop some of the worst practices of the oil industry, such as the use of oil wastewater laden with toxic chemicals in crop irrigation, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get sponsors for those bills.  Supposedly environmentally friendly legislators control the legislature and the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion, and proudly portray themselves as cutting edge trendsetters in the fight for a clean energy future. But the reality is deeply contradictory. The record shows that elected officials in California are almost completely unwilling to take on the oil industry.\n\n\nTo see how this is playing out, one needs to look no further than our Governor, Jerry Brown, who claims that he is boldly taking action on climate change and is an environmental champion. However, this is the same governor who has taken over 10 million for himself and his initiatives from the fossil fuel industry in his last two terms in office and has fired his own regulators - at the request of the oil industry - for doing their job in trying to protect public health and the environment.   \n\n\nLeaders can\xe2\x80\x99t take the oil industry\xe2\x80\x99s money and do their bidding, and be a climate or environmental champions at the same time.   We need champions looking out for the people, our communities, and the climate, not the profits of the oil industry which is engaging in demonstrably bad practices. Until we stop the flow of money into our elected officials pockets, nothing is going to change.   \n\n\nTHE SOLUTION\t\n\n\nUntil oil money stops poisoning our democracy, the people of the state of California will continue to be poisoned by industry practices. California\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders need to make their primary allegiance clear: is it to the oil industry or the health and safety of their constituents? The days of having it both ways have to come to an end. \n\n\nWe will force enough state elected officials to stop taking these toxic dollars and prioritize public health over oil the interests of the industry, and finally break the logjam in Sacramento and put an end to the most toxic industry practices. \n\n\nOrganizations Supporting This Campaign: Rootskeeper, Food & Water Watch, Center for Biological Diversity, California for Progress, Courage Campaign, CREDO, The Other 98%, Californians Against Fracking, and Progressive Democrats of America.""",2017-05-18 23:21:23.415608,16th St and H St Sacramento CA,"https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.5803065,-121.4843092",Oil Money Out March and Rally,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,,['https://facebook.com/events/277604746028035'],risestronger.org,[],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/oil-money-out-march-and-rally

In 2000 the Oregon Public School Funding and Equalization Amendment was approved by voters requiring the state to fund public education. The funding gap has been between 23.9% and 38% every year since the QEM was created. \nOregon public schools have been in a funding crisis for decades. This year, with a 1.6 billion budget shortfall, this crisis has hit its peak. Current proposed cuts to K-12 education will result in larger class sizes, further cuts to art, music, and PE, as well as fewer librarians and counselors. \nThe event will begin with short panel presenting the legislative and tax background of our current situation. Following the panel, the floor will be open for community testimony. Legislators from the metro area as well as those serving on the Education and Revenue committees of the House and Senate have been invited to listen to their constituents concerns and questions. \nPublic education is a civil right for every child.

It will be held at  Montgomery Bell State Park Inn, 45 minutes from Nashville, Tennessee and there is no public transportation there.

This year, AZAN is jumping back into the fray with an evening guaranteed to be bigger, funnier, and definitely meatier. \nTarra Lazos Creative is very pleased to announce it will be producing Arizona Advocacy Network's Roast of Adrian Fontes on Friday, May 19, at 7:00 PM.  Following a year which found them calling out the Maricopa County Recorder's Office quite frequently in the press, in 2017 they will go for broke, sitting the new Recorder himself up on stage and letting him have it in person!  \nThe evening will begin with cocktails and a specially created menu featuring desert soul food before we sit down for the main course: the man himself, Adrian Fontes. The Marines may have toughened him, and a contentious race may have hardened him, but is he ready for what a star-studded panel of roasters will bring? \nEverybody is jumping on board for this, too! Joining emcee Richie Taylor and an already star-filled lineup including Rep Ken Clark and Robbie Sherwood will be Secretary of State Michele Reagan!  \nThe roast, which will be held at FABRiC (132 East Sixth Street, Tempe, AZ 85281), formerly the Tempe Performing Arts Center, will be catered by Chef Appolon Lewis in conjunction with San Carlos Apache educator Twila Cassadore and Tarra Lazos Creative and promises to be the highlight of the 2017 fundraising season.

In order to activate the Rapid Response line, we need to train up teams who will be the hotline dispatchers and first responders to and confirm reports of raids. These trainings will focus on training 1st Responders how to confirm an ICE raid is occurring and how to be legal observers of the raid. We will also be training those who want to be hotline dispatchers on how to receive calls, how to refer them out to 1st responders to confirm the raid, and how to activate the rapid response supports once the raid has been confirmed.\nThese trainings are open to anyone who would like to join the Statewide Raid Rapid Response team but we ask that you only attend if you are committed to be a part of the team moving forward.

As a community, we need to come together and stand up against the racially sparked discrimination and cruelty to our fellow community members. \nThose who are not being targeted need to stand up and fight for those that ARE being targeted. This event is to show solidarity in the fight for racial equality and justice.\nWe cannot accept police brutality, racial profiling, excessive incarceration for minor infractions, completely unjustified arrests, and shocking, indefensible deaths. None of these things are acceptable, and we ALL need to stand up against them. We need to show that we are unified; that no one is turning their backs on anyone. \nPlease join us in honoring Dr Martin Luther King, Representative John Lewis,  Medgar Evers, William Louis Moore and every single individual who risked their lives in that march to stand up for justice!\nStand up with us today! In a day and age where you won\'t risk being killed for doing so. So many faced unimaginable danger and even murder for standing up in 1965. Can we really stand idly by in 2017 when, generally speaking, that same threat no longer exists?\nThe sun won\'t be down yet, so remember sunscreen/hat and maybe a snack. We will provide water, but you may want to bring extra to be safe.\nAlso, we will have some signs for those without, but please plan on making your own sign.

We are advocates who believe that every child, regardless of race, sex, socioeconomic status and ability, deserve the opportunity to experience the transformative power of a well-rounded education.\nMISSION: To promote public education through peaceful demonstration and action.\nVISION\nPublic Schools will be safe, inclusive spaces for learning and critical thinking, where all children discover their passion(s) and role(s) as citizens. As members of March for Public Education, we aim to advance policy and recursively address issues of: equity, inclusion, accountability, a well-funded institution and the right to organize.\nOUR PRINCIPLES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must fight for equity. All students should enter the classroom on equal footing. Special educators, social workers, school psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, occupational therapists, and countless others are critical to creating an equitable school culture. Striving toward this ideal is the only way to create a meritocratic environment that is fair for all students.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must strive to create a safe space for all. In this regard, schools have the recursive responsibility to combat racism, sexism, ableism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public education empowers children to discover their desires, passions and potential. In turn, children become tenacious adults who are critical thinkers, involved citizens and lifelong learners. The arts, humanities, mathematics, sciences, and physical education are equally vital in developing the whole child.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Schools must be held accountable in the fight for equity. Accountability can include thoughtful standards and purposeful testing. These structures should strive to help schools provide a better education to students and should coincide with intentional professional development for teachers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A well-funded public education is a right of all children, regardless of their intersectional identities. For-profit educational institutions and their fundamental motivation for capital are incongruous in helping children realize their full identity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Faculty and staff have the right and responsibility to organize. As members of the institution that is public education, stakeholders must challenge societal paradigms on behalf of students and the community.""",2017-05-18 23:24:09.659718,"Salt Lake City, UT","https://www.google.com/maps?q=40.7607793,-111.8910474",March for Public Education - Salt Lake City,Parsed www.risestronger.org for training data,Education,['https://facebook.com/events/1261647977256958'],risestronger.org,['Education'],['Rally Or Protest'],https://risestronger.org/events/march-for-public-education-salt-lake-city

Boulder Friend's Meeting, Showing Up for Racial Justice Boulder, Unitarian Universalist Church of Boulder, and Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center are co-hosting a presentation with Debby Irving, author of the award-winning book, Waking Up White, and Finding Myself in the Story of Race.\n\n\nDebby will use historical and media images to tell the story of how she unlearned her white-skewed belief system. This workshop is designed to support white people in making the paradigm shift from \xe2\x80\x98fixing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98helping\xe2\x80\x99 those believed to be \xe2\x80\x9cneedy,\xe2\x80\x9d to focusing on internalized sense of white superiority and its role in perpetuating racism at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and cultural levels. The two-hour program, which Debby frequently presents at the White Privilege Conference, includes time for reflection, dialog, and Q&A.\n\n\nDebby Irving is a racial justice educator and author.  A community organizer and classroom teacher for 25 years, Debby Irving grappled with racial injustice without understanding racism as a systemic issue or her own whiteness as an obstacle to it. \n\nAs general manager of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Dance Umbrella and First Night, and later as an elementary school teacher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she struggled to make sense of tensions in racially mixed settings she could feel but could not explain.

Lectures cover the history of people's movements and corporate power, and the dramatic organizing over the last decade in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Colorado, Washington, and Oregon by communities confronting agribusiness, the oil and gas industry, corporate hegemony over worker rights, and others. \nIncluded with enrollment in the Democracy School is a 300 plus-page notebook of background reading material.\nIn Boulder County and many other counties in Colorado, we are facing impending oil and gas drilling as our moratoriums end. Join us for Democracy School as we learn more about how to continue the fight for local control over fracking and other issues in our communities. \nLearn more about Democracy School in this short video from the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund:    \nQuestions?
